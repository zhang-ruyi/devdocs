<p>Add a new function <code>spdk_nvme_bytes_to_numd</code> to transfer bytes to number of dwords.</p>
<p>Added a new custom transport <code>SPDK_NVME_TRANSPORT_VFIOUSER</code> to enable NVMe driver running with NVMe over vfio-user target.</p>
<p>Added the vfio-user custom transport implementation in NVMe driver which can connect to NVMe over vfio-user target via vfio-user transport.</p>
<p>Added a new function <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_set_remove_cb</code> to remove or override <code>remove_cb</code> and <code>remove_ctx</code> specified when the controller was probed.</p>
<p>Added support for ZNS zone append command with new API <code>spdk_nvme_zns_zone_append</code> and <code>spdk_nvme_zns_zone_append_with_md</code>.</p>
<h2>nvmf</h2>
<p><code>nvmf_fc_lld_fini</code> now takes callback and hence updating FC Broadcom LLD driver to the latest is required.</p>
<p>FC transport supported primary tagging and VMID.</p>
<p>Broadcom FC LLD driver and SPDK NVMe-oF FC transport consolidated one LLD API, <code>nvmf_fc_init_poller_queues</code> into another LLD API <code>nvmf_fc_init_q</code>. Hence updating Broadcom FC LLD driver to the latest is required.</p>
<p>The functions <code>destroy</code> and <code>qpair_fini</code> in the transport interface now accept a <code>cb_fn</code> and <code>cb_arg</code> to call upon completion, and their execution can be asynchronous.</p>
<p>The SPDK NVMe-oF target now supports async event notification for discovery log changes. This allows the initiator to create persistent connection to discovery controller and be notified of any discovery log changes.</p>
<p>An <code>opts_size</code> element was added in the <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__transport__opts.html">spdk_nvmf_transport_opts</a></code> structure to solve the ABI compatiblity issue between different SPDK version. And also add <code>opts_size</code> parameter in <code>spdk_nvmf_transport_opts_init</code> function.</p>
<p>Added a new custom vfio-user transport implementation in NVMe-oF which can provide emulated NVMe devices to QEMU and SPDK NVMe driver.</p>
<p>Added new API <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_listen_ext</code> that uses <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__listen__opts.html">spdk_nvmf_listen_opts</a></code> to allow passing generic options to specific transport. This functionality replaces one provided with <code>nvmf_subsystem_set_options</code>. Also removed <code>nvmf_subsystem_set_options</code> RPC that allowed transport specific options within subsystem.</p>
<p>The <code>trsvcid</code> in <code>nvmf_subsystem_add_listener</code> RPC is now optional.</p>
<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>An new optional parameter <code>wait</code> was added to the RPC <code>iscsi_create_portal_group</code>, and an new RPC <code>iscsi_start_portal_group</code> was added. They will be used not to start listening on portals for a portal group until all associated target nodes are created at startup, otherwise some iSCSI initiators may fail to re-login when SPDK iSCSI target application restarts.</p>
<p>Two optional parameter <code>--small-buf-pool-size</code> and <code>--large-buf-pool-size</code> were added into <code>bdev_set_options</code> function.</p>

The <code>spdk_bdev_part_base_construct_ext</code> function takes bdev name as an argument instead of bdev structure to avoid a race condition that can happen when the bdev is being removed between a call to get its structure based on a name and actually opening it.</p>
<p>Removed <code>spdk_bdev_config_text</code> function for bdev modules to report legacy config.</p>
<h2>blobstore</h2>
<p>A new <code>spdk_bdev_create_bs_dev_ext</code> function has been added and <code>spdk_bdev_create_bs_dev_from_desc</code> function has been deprecated.</p>

<h2>event</h2>
<p>Removed <code>spdk_subsystem_config</code> callback for submodules as part of legacy config removal.</p>
<p>Removed <code>spdk_app_get_running_config</code> function that printed configuration in legacy format, and removed <code>usr1_handler</code> from <code>struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__app__opts.html" title="Event framework initialization options.">spdk_app_opts</a></code> callback that was used to call it.</p>
<p>Added SPDK thread scheduler framework which is used to rebalance load among CPU cores. The scheduler implementation is pluggable and two schedulers are added first, <code>static</code> scheduler and <code>gscheduler</code> scheduler.</p>
<p><code>static</code> scheduler is used by default and does not reschedule threads and keeps the initial assignments.</p>
<p>CPU frequency governor framework and implementation are also added. <code>dpdk_governor</code> is the first implementation and is based on rte_power library of DPDK. <code>gscheduler</code> scheduler utilizes the CPU frequency governor.</p>
<p>Scheduler and governor frameworks are experimental features.</p>
<h2>fio</h2>
<p>Bdev fio_plugin no longer supports legacy configuration files. Options <code>spdk_conf</code> and <code>spdk_json_conf</code> have to point to valid JSON configuration.</p>
<h2>gpt</h2>
<p>Removed option to disable GPT probing via legacy configuration. Please use generic bdev functionality to replicate the behavior. See <code>bdev_set_options --disable-auto-examine</code> and <code>bdev_examine</code> RPC.</p>
<h2>intel-ipsec-mb</h2>
<p>Updated intel-ipsec-mb submodule to v0.54</p>
<h2>isa-l</h2>
<p>Updated ISA-L submodule to v2.29.0.</p>
<h2>iscsi</h2>
<p>The iSCSI target supports iSCSI login redirection feature to achieve fault tolerance and load balancing particularly in scale out iSCSI target system, which runs multiple SPDK iSCSI targets.</p>

<p>A new API <code>spdk_json_decode_object_relaxed</code> was added to allow parsing json values even if decoder for a given key is not found.</p>
<p>A new API <code>spdk_json_free_object</code> was added to free memory allocated by <code>spdk_json_decode_object</code>.</p>
<h2>log</h2>
<p>A log flag structure, <code>spdk_log_register_flag</code>, <code>spdk_log_get_first_flag</code>, <code>spdk_log_get_next_flag</code> and macro <code>SPDK_LOG_REGISTER_COMPONENT</code>, have been added which enable registering and interacting with log flags. Added <code>SPDK_INFOLOG</code>, <code>SPDK_DEBUGLOG</code> and <code>SPDK_LOGDUMP</code> macros to display logs for specified log flag.</p>
<p>The log flags in the event framework <code>-L</code> and several SPDK applications has been enabled on release builds of SPDK. On debug builds this option will additionally set log print level to <code>SPDK_LOG_DEBUG</code>.</p>
<p>A new API <code>spdk_log_enable_timestamps</code> and new RPC <code>log_enable_timestamps</code> was added to toggle log timestamps.</p>
<h2>miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The contents of the log_rpc library have been moved to the event library. The log_rpc library now no longer exists.</p>
<p>The contents of the app_rpc library have been moved to the event library. The app_rpc library now no longer exists.</p>
<p>The contents of the bdev_rpc library have been moved to the bdev library. The app_rpc library now no longer exists.</p>
<p>The bdevperf application now disables the zcopy API by default. Prior to this change, bdevperf enabled using the zcopy API by default which caused a performance impact of up to 25% on bdevs that don't natively support zcopy because the API emulates zero-copy by allocating a buffer. The bdevperf <code>-x</code> param was renamed to <code>-Z</code> and the default value changed to false. For bdevs that support zcopy, use the -Z flag to enable using zcopy API.</p>
<h2>net</h2>
<p>Net framework intended for use by user-space TCP stacks was removed.</p>
<h2>nvme</h2>
<p>Zoned Namespace Command Set support has been added to NVMe driver, see <code><a class="el" href="nvme__zns_8h.html" title="NVMe driver public API extension for Zoned Namespace Command Set.">nvme_zns.h</a></code> for details.</p>
<p>New APIs, <code>spdk_nvme_detach_async</code> and <code>spdk_nvme_detach_poll_async</code>, have been added to detach multiple controllers in parallel to mitigate lengthy shutdown notification of a few NVMe SSDs.</p>
<p>New APIs, <code>spdk_nvme_ns_get_ana_group_id</code> and <code>spdk_nvme_ns_get_ana_state</code>, have been added to get ANA group ID and ANA state of the given namespace, respectively.</p>
<p>If no specific command set is requested (by setting the command_set member in the <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__ctrlr__opts.html" title="NVMe controller initialization options.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_opts</a></code> structure), SPDK will automatically select the most appropriate command set based on what the controller supports.</p>

<p>New optional parameters, <code>enable_placement_id</code> and <code>enable_quickack</code> were added to the <code>sock_impl_set_options</code> RPC.</p>
<p>A new RPC <code>bdev_examine_bdev</code> was added to allow users to examine a bdev explicitly. It can be used only if bdev_auto_examine is set to false by the RPC <code>bdev_set_options</code>.</p>
<p>New optional parameters <code>no_wr_batching</code> and <code>control_msg_num</code> were added to the RPC 'nvmf_create_transport'.</p>
<p>New RPCs, <code>iscsi_target_node_set_redirect</code> and <code>iscsi_target_node_request_logout</code>, have been added, and a new optional parameter <code>private</code> has been added to the RPC <code>iscsi_create_portal_group</code> to support iSCSI login redirection feature.</p>

<p>The <code>spdk_scsi_dev_construct</code> and <code>spdk_scsi_dev_add_lun</code> eventually may be deprecated and removed.</p>
<h2>sock</h2>
<p>The <code>enable_placement_id</code> field was added in the <code>struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__sock__impl__opts.html" title="SPDK socket implementation options.">spdk_sock_impl_opts</a></code> to make the placement_id feature configurable by users. The default setting is not enabled.</p>
<p>The <code>enable_quick_ack</code> field was added in the <code>struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__sock__impl__opts.html" title="SPDK socket implementation options.">spdk_sock_impl_opts</a></code> to enable or disable quick ack for the POSIX sock module. The default setting is not enabled.</p>
<h2>thread</h2>
<p><code>fd_group</code> is applied to support interrupt mode. New APIs were added to support an experimental interrupt mode. This allows modules or libraries to selectively register file descriptors that the spdk_thread can wait on, as an alternative to polling. In v20.10, this functionality is enabled in a very small subset of SPDK libraries and modules.</p>

<p>Several APIs were added to <code><a class="el" href="accel__engine_8h.html" title="Acceleration engine abstraction layer.">accel_engine.h</a></code> to support batched submission of operations.</p>
<p>Several APIs were added to <code><a class="el" href="accel__engine_8h.html" title="Acceleration engine abstraction layer.">accel_engine.h</a></code> to support dualcast operations.</p>
<h2>accel_fw</h2>
<p>The accel_fw was updated to no longer require the app to allocate an accel_task on its behalf. All public APIs now take a callback arg as the parameter that used to be the accel_task.</p>
<p>The accel_fw API <code>spdk_accel_task_size</code> was removed as it is no longer required.</p>
<p>The accel_fw was updated to support compare, dualcast, crc32c.</p>
<p>The accel_fw introduced batching support for all commands in all plug-ins. See docs for detailed information.</p>
<h2>bdev</h2>
<p>A new API <code>spdk_bdev_abort</code> has been added to submit abort requests to abort all I/Os whose callback context match to the bdev on the given channel.</p>
<h2>build</h2>
<p>The fio plugins now compile to <code>build/fio</code> and are named <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__bdev.html">spdk_bdev</a></code> and <code>spdk_nvme</code>. Existing fio configuration files will need to be updated.</p>
<h2>dpdk</h2>
<p>Updated DPDK submodule to DPDK 20.05.</p>
<h2>env</h2>
<p>Several new APIs have been added to provide greater flexibility in registering and accessing polled mode PCI drivers. See <code><a class="el" href="env_8h.html" title="Encapsulated third-party dependencies.">env.h</a></code> for more details.</p>

<p>A new function <code>qpair_iterate_requests</code> has been added to the nvme transport interface. ALl implementations of the transport interface will have to implement that function.</p>
<h2>nvmf</h2>
<p>The NVMe-oF target no longer supports connecting scheduling configuration and instead always uses what was previously called "transport" scheduling.</p>
<p><code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_accept</code> no longer exists. The accept process now occurs automatically after the creation of an nvmf target and queue pairs are assigned to poll groups by the underlying transport. Further, <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__transport__ops.html">spdk_nvmf_transport_ops</a></code> has changed such that the accept function pointer no longer takes a function pointer as an argument. Instead, transports should call <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_new_qpair</code> whenever they previously would have called that callback.</p>
<p>The NVMe-oF target now supports aborting any submitted NVM or Admin command. Previously, the NVMe-oF target could abort only Asynchronous Event Request commands.</p>
<h2>rdma</h2>
<p>A new <code>rdma</code> library has been added. It is an abstraction layer over different RDMA providers. Two providers are available - verbs (used by default when RDMA is enabled or enabled explicitly using &ndash;with-rdma=verbs) and mlx5 Direct Verbs aka DV (enabled by &ndash;with-rdma=mlx5_dv). Using mlx5_dv requires libmlx5 installed on the system.</p>
<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>Parameter <code>-p</code> or <code>--max-qpairs-per-ctrlr</code> of <code>nvmf_create_transport</code> RPC command accepted by the rpc.py script is deprecated, new parameter <code>-m</code> or <code>--max-io-qpairs-per-ctrlr</code> was added.</p>
<p>Added <code>sock_impl_get_options</code> and <code>sock_impl_set_options</code> RPC methods.</p>
<p>Command line parameters <code>-r</code> and <code>--rpc-socket</code> will longer accept TCP ports. RPC server must now be started on a Unix domain socket. Exposing RPC on the network, as well as providing proper authentication (if needed) is now a responsibility of the user.</p>
<p>The <code>bdev_set_options</code> RPC has a new option, <code>bdev_auto_examine</code> to control the auto examine function of bdev modules.</p>
<p>New RPCs <code>sock_impl_get_options</code> and <code>sock_impl_set_options</code> been added to expose new socket features. See <code>sock</code> section for more details.</p>
<h2>sock</h2>
<p>Added <code>spdk_sock_impl_get_opts</code> and <code>spdk_sock_impl_set_opts</code> functions to set/get socket layer configuration options. Options can be set independently for each implementation.</p>
<p>Added <code>recv_buf_size</code> and 'send_buf_size' socket layer options. They are used only in posix implementation.</p>
<p>Added <code>uring</code> based socket implementation, the code is located in module/sock/uring. This feature is only available in Linux which requires kernel version is greater than 5.4.3. Currently, our CI pool added the uring based socket tests for iSCSI target and also the tests for SPDK NVMe-oF tcp transport.</p>
<p>Added <code>enable_recv_pipe</code> socket layer option to allow disabling of double buffering on receive. New option is used only in posix implementation.</p>
<p>Added <code>enable_zerocopy_send</code> socket layer option to allow disabling of zero copy flow on send. New option is used only in posix implementation.</p>
<h2>util</h2>
<p>Some previously exposed CRC32 functions have been removed from the public API - <code>spdk_crc32_update</code>, <code>spdk_crc32_table_init</code>, and the <code>spdk_crc32_table</code> struct.</p>
<h2>vhost</h2>
<p>The function <code>spdk_vhost_blk_get_dev</code> has been removed.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v20-04"></a>
v20.04: SPDK Top, IDXD, NVMe qpair groups</h1>
<p>IDXD engine support for compare has been added.</p>
<h2>configuration</h2>
<p>Legacy INI style configuration for SPDK applications has been deprecated and will be removed in future release. Please switch to JSON-RPC configuration files and/or RPC driven run-time configuration.</p>
<h2>copy</h2>
<p>The copy engine library, modules and public APIs have been renamed. Use of the word <code>copy</code> has been replaced with the word <code>accel</code> short for accelerator in preparation for adding new capabilities in the future. Additionally, APIs for what was previously called the <code>memcpy</code> engine have been renamed to identify the engine as a software accelerator.</p>
<h2>crypto</h2>
<p>Support for AES_XTS was added for the QAT polled mode driver (pmd). The create RPC <code>bdev_crypto_create</code> has 2 new optional parameters: cipher and key2. Cipher can be either AES_CBC (default) or AES_XTS. AES_XTS is only valid when using the QAT polled mode driver. The key2 parameter is the second key required for AES_XTS.</p>
<h2>event</h2>
<p>Reactors now accumulate CPU stats and they are retrieved by the RPC <code>framework_get_reactors</code>.</p>
<h2>idxd</h2>
<p>IDXD support was added in the form of a low level library that can directly utilize the IDXD offload engine as well as an accel plug-in module allowing for use with the generic accel framework API. IDXD is the first in a family of offload engines that share the same interface, specifically DSA is added here. More info can be found here: <a href="https://01.org/blogs/2019/introducing-intel-data-streaming-accelerator">https://01.org/blogs/2019/introducing-intel-data-streaming-accelerator</a></p>
<p>Much of the implementation models IOAT, however the low level interfaces are very different. The RPC to enable IDXD requires a configuration number as well. The code includes two pre-defined configurations of IDXD groups/work queues/engines. A future version will provide an interface to allow for setting of individual configuration parameters.</p>
<p>IDXD is not yet available so this feature should be considered experimental. It will be built up with additional documentation as an ongoing activity.</p>
<h2>iscsi</h2>
<p>The iSCSI target now creates a lightweight thread per poll group instead of assuming a pool of lightweight threads already exist at start up time. A poll group is a collection of unrelated iSCSI connections. Each poll group is only accessed from the associated lightweight thread.</p>
<h2>ftl</h2>
<p>Several changes have been made to the <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__ftl__conf.html">spdk_ftl_conf</a></code>, <code>spdk_ftl_dev_init_ops</code>, and <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__ftl__attrs.html">spdk_ftl_attrs</a></code> structs. Please see <code>include/spdk/ftl.h</code> for more details.</p>
<h2>miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The <code>--json-ignore-init-errors</code> command line parameter has been added to ignore initialization errors on JSON config load.</p>
<p>The public header file io_channel.h has been removed. Please use <a class="el" href="thread_8h.html" title="Thread.">thread.h</a> which has the exact same API.</p>
<h2>nvme</h2>
<p>Exported internal nvme_ctrlr_cmd_security_receive/send() APIs as public APIs with "the spdk_" prefix.</p>
<p>Added <code>priority</code> field in <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__transport__id.html" title="NVMe transport identifier.">spdk_nvme_transport_id</a></code>, this field is used to specify the priority of the NVMe-oF connection, and currently it is used for NVMe-oF tcp connection.</p>
<p>A new poll group API has been added to allow for pooling of nvme qpairs across a single entity which can be polled for completions. This new API consists of the <code>spdk_nvme_poll_group</code> family of functions. As a result of this new API, all NVMe transports are expected to implement several poll group related functions.</p>
<p>A new flag, <code>create_only</code>, has been added to the <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__io__qpair__opts.html" title="NVMe I/O queue pair initialization options.">spdk_nvme_io_qpair_opts</a></code> structure. This flag allows a user to call <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_get_default_io_qpair</code> without also connecting the qpair within the context of that call.</p>
<p>As a result of the <code>create_only</code> flag, two new API functions, <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_connect_io_qpair</code> and <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_disconnect_io_qpair</code>, have been added to facilitate connecting newly created qpairs (for example, after they have been added to a poll group) and disconnecting qpairs without destroying them (for example to disconnect a qpair before migrating it to a new poll group and reconnecting it).</p>
<p>The functions <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_alloc_cmb_io_buffer</code> and <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_free_cmb_io_buffer</code> have been changed to <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_map_cmb</code> and <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_unmap_cmb</code> respectively.</p>
<p>An additional function, <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_reserve_cmb</code>, has been added to facilitate reserving the entire size of the controller memory buffer for data transfer.</p>
<h2>nvme_cuse</h2>
<p><code>spdk_nvme_cuse_get_ctrlr_name</code> now takes two additional parameters, <code>char *name</code> which stores the pointer to the controller name, and <code>size_t *size</code> which stores the length of the name. The return type has also been changed from char * to int.</p>
<p><code>spdk_nvme_cuse_get_ns_name</code> now takes two additional parameters, <code>char *name</code> which stores the pointer to the namespace name, and <code>size_t *size</code> which stores the length of the name. The return type has also been changed from char * to int.</p>
<h2>nvme_opal</h2>
<p>Several public OPAL structure definitions have been changed since the last release.</p>
<h2>nvmf</h2>
<p><code><a class="el" href="nvmf_8h.html#a12a23b74ddfec6b8683b3a0afccba10d" title="Destroy a poll group.">spdk_nvmf_poll_group_destroy()</a></code> is now asynchronous and accepts a completion callback.</p>
<p>The NVMe-oF target now creates a lightweight thread per poll group instead of assuming a pool of lightweight threads already exist at start up time. A poll group is a collection of unrelated NVMe-oF connections. Each poll group is only accessed from the associated lightweight thread.</p>
<p>A new struct, <code>spdk_nvmf_subsystem_listener</code>, has been added to encapsulate the subsystem specific nature of a listener object.</p>
<p><code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_listen</code> no longer accepts a callback function or argument. It also returns an int to indicate the status of the listen call.</p>
<p>The execution of <code>spdk_nvme_poll_group_destroy</code> is now asynchronous and the function accepts a cb_fn and cb_arg to call upon completion.</p>
<p>The execution of <code>spdk_nvmf_subsystem_add_listener</code> is now asynchronous and the function accepts a cb_fn and cb_arg to call upon completion.</p>
<p>The <code><a class="el" href="nvmf__transport_8h.html" title="NVMe-oF Target transport plugin API.">nvmf_transport.h</a></code> header has been made public to allow custom NVMe-oF transports to integrate with NVMe-oF libraries without using internal APIs.</p>
<h2>ocf</h2>
<p>Updated the OCF submodule to OCF v20.03</p>
<p>New version of OCF comes with API changes and bug fixes</p>
<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>A new RPC <code>thread_set_cpumask</code> has been added to set the cpumask of the thread to the specified value.</p>
<p>A new RPC <code>thread_get_pollers</code> has been added to retrieve pollers from SPDK threads.</p>
<p>A new RPC <code>thread_get_io_channels</code> has been added to retrieve I/O channels from SPDK threads.</p>
<p>A new RPC <code>bdev_rbd_resize</code> has been added to resize Ceph RBD bdevs.</p>
<h2>sock</h2>
<p>The <code>spdk_sock_set_priority</code> function has been removed since the feature to set the sock priority will be contained in two new functions, i.e., <code>spdk_sock_listen_ext</code> and <code>spdk_sock_connect_ext</code>. Users may now specify the priority of the socket in the opts that they want to use.</p>
<h2>spdk_top</h2>
<p>A new application, <code>spdk_top</code>, has been added which allows users to monitor resource consumption by a running SPDK application. More information on this application can be found in <code>app/spdk_top/README</code>.</p>
<h2>thread</h2>
<p>A new function <code>spdk_thread_lib_init_ext</code> has been added, and the function <code>spdk_thread_lib_init</code> has been deprecated. The user of <code>spdk_thread_lib_init_ext</code> is expected to implement both functions <code>spdk_thread_op_fn</code> and <code>spdk_thread_op_supported_fn</code>. <code>spdk_thread_op_supported_fn</code> is called to check whether the SPDK thread operation is supported. <code>spdk_thread_op_fn</code> is called to execute the SPDK thread operation. Current SPDK operation types are <code>SPDK_THREAD_OP_NEW</code> and <code>SPDK_THREAD_OP_RESCHED</code>. The operation <code>SPDK_THREAD_OP_NEW</code> is called each time a new thread is created. The operation <code>SPDK_THREAD_OP_RESCHED</code> is called when SPDK thread needs to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>A unique ID has been added for each created SPDK thread, it is retrieved by a new function <code>spdk_thread_get_id</code>, and the SPDK thread which has the specific ID is got by a new function <code>spdk_thread_get_by_id</code>.</p>
<p>A new function <code>spdk_thread_cpumask</code> has been added to set the current thread's cpumask to the specified value. The function requires the operation <code>SPDK_THREAD_OP_RESCHED</code> is supported.</p>
<p>A new function <code>spdk_poller_register_named</code> has been added to set arbitrary name to the created poller. If NULL, the name is set to the pointer of the poller function.</p>
<p>The function <code>spdk_thread_poll</code> now measures run time per call correctly on multiple SPDK threads configuration, and a new function <code>spdk_thread_get_last_tsc</code> has been added to use together.</p>
<p>Voluntary termination of SPDK thread has been supported by refining the functions <code>spdk_thread_exit</code> and <code>spdk_thread_poll</code>.</p>
<h2>util</h2>
<p>New functions <code>spdk_sn32_lt</code> and <code>spdk_sn32_gt</code> have been added. They compare two sequence numbers based on serial number arithmetic.</p>
<h2>vhost</h2>
<p>Poll groups per session have been replaced by SPDK threads per vhost controller.</p>
<h2>vmd</h2>
<p>A new function, <code>spdk_vmd_fini</code>, has been added. It releases all resources acquired by the VMD library through the <code>spdk_vmd_init</code> call.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v20-01"></a>
v20.01: Optimized thin provisioning, FTL bdev, VMD hot plug, FUSED support</h1>
<h2>bdev</h2>
<p>A new function, <code>spdk_bdev_set_timeout</code>, has been added to set per descriptor I/O timeouts.</p>
<p>A new class of functions <code>spdk_bdev_compare*</code>, have been added to allow native bdev support of block comparisons and compare-and-write.</p>
<p>A new class of bdev events, <code>SPDK_BDEV_EVENT_MEDIA_MANAGEMENT</code>, has been added to allow bdevs which expose raw media to alert all I/O channels of pending media management events.</p>
<p>A new API was added <code>spdk_bdev_io_get_aux_buf</code> allowing the caller to request an auxiliary buffer for its own private use. The API is used in the same manner that <code>spdk_bdev_io_get_buf</code> is used and the length of the buffer is always the same as the bdev_io primary buffer. 'spdk_bdev_io_put_aux_buf' frees the allocated auxiliary buffer.</p>
<h2>blobfs</h2>
<p>Added boolean return value for function spdk_fs_set_cache_size to indicate its operation result.</p>
<p>Added <code>blobfs_set_cache_size</code> RPC method to set cache size for blobstore filesystem.</p>
<h2>blobstore</h2>
<p>Added new <code>use_extent_table</code> option to <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__blob__opts.html">spdk_blob_opts</a></code> for creating blobs with Extent Table descriptor. Using this metadata format, dramatically decreases number of writes required to persist each cluster allocation for thin provisioned blobs. Extent Table descriptor is enabled by default. See the <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/blob.html#blob_pg_cluster_layout">Blobstore Programmer's Guide</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>dpdk</h2>
<p>Updated DPDK submodule to DPDK 19.11.</p>
<h2>env_dpdk</h2>
<p><code>spdk_env_dpdk_post_init</code> now takes a boolean, <code>legacy_mem</code>, as an argument.</p>
<p>A new function, <code>spdk_env_dpdk_dump_mem_stats</code>, prints information about the memory consumed by DPDK to a file specified by the user. A new utility, <code>scripts/dpdk_mem_info.py</code>, wraps this function and prints the output in an easy to read way.</p>
<h2>event</h2>
<p>The functions <code>spdk_reactor_enable_framework_monitor_context_switch()</code> and <code>spdk_reactor_framework_monitor_context_switch_enabled()</code> have been changed to <code><a class="el" href="event_8h.html#a367fa3d40d7f507cc4f258b27592fb43" title="Enable or disable monitoring of context switches.">spdk_framework_enable_context_switch_monitor()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="event_8h.html#aa6e70166c6ac9e7e7399d1b140979d29" title="Return whether context switch monitoring is enabled.">spdk_framework_context_switch_monitor_enabled()</a></code>, respectively.</p>
<h2>ftl</h2>
<p>All NVMe dependencies were removed from ftl library. From now ftl library is using bdev_zone API. bdev_ftl becomes virtual bdev.</p>
<p><code>ctrlr</code> and <code>trid</code> fields in <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__ftl__dev__init__opts.html">spdk_ftl_dev_init_opts</a></code> structure were replaced by <code>base_bdev_desc</code>.</p>
<p><code>bdev_ftl_create</code> RPC method <code>trtype</code> and <code>traddr</code> parameters were replaced by <code>base_bdev</code> parameter.</p>
<p><code>spdk_ftl_module_init</code> and <code>spdk_ftl_module_fini</code> functions were removed.</p>
<p><code>spdk_ftl_punit_range</code> and <code>ftl_module_init_opts</code> structures were removed.</p>
<h2>isa-l</h2>
<p>Updated ISA-L submodule to commit f3993f5c0b6911 which includes implementation and optimization for aarch64.</p>
<p>Enabled ISA-L on aarch64 by default in addition to x86.</p>
<h2>nvme</h2>
<p><code>delayed_pcie_doorbell</code> parameter in <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__io__qpair__opts.html" title="NVMe I/O queue pair initialization options.">spdk_nvme_io_qpair_opts</a></code> was renamed to <code>delay_cmd_submit</code> to allow reuse in other transports.</p>
<p>Added RDMA WR batching to NVMf RDMA initiator. Send and receive WRs are chained together and posted with a single call to ibv_post_send(receive) in the next call to qpair completion processing function. Batching is controlled by 'delay_cmd_submit' qpair option.</p>
<p>The NVMe-oF initiator now supports plugging out of tree NVMe-oF transports. In order to facilitate this feature, several small API changes have been made:</p>
<p>The <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__transport__id.html" title="NVMe transport identifier.">spdk_nvme_transport_id</a></code> struct now contains a trstring member used to identify the transport. A new function, <code>spdk_nvme_transport_available_by_name</code>, has been added. A function table, <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__transport__ops.html">spdk_nvme_transport_ops</a></code>, and macro, <code>SPDK_NVME_TRANSPORT_REGISTER</code>, have been added which enable registering out of tree transports.</p>
<p>A new function, <code>spdk_nvme_ns_supports_compare</code>, allows a user to check whether a given namespace supports the compare operation.</p>
<p>A new family of functions, <code>spdk_nvme_ns_compare*</code>, give the user access to submitting compare commands to NVMe namespaces.</p>
<p>A new function, <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_cmd_get_log_page_ext</code>, gives users more granular control over the command dwords sent in log page requests.</p>
<h2>nvmf</h2>
<p>Add SockPriority option in [Transport] section, this can be used for NVMe-oF target on TCP transport to set sock priority for the incomming TCP connections.</p>
<p>The NVMe-oF target now supports plugging out of tree NVMe-oF transports. In order to facilitate this feature, several small API changes have been made:</p>
<p>The <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__transport__id.html" title="NVMe transport identifier.">spdk_nvme_transport_id</a></code> struct now contains a trstring member used to identify the transport. <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_get_transport</code>, <code>spdk_nvmf_transport_opts_init</code>, and <code>spdk_nvmf_transport_create</code> all have been modified to take a string. A function table, <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__transport__ops.html">spdk_nvmf_transport_ops</a></code>, and macro, <code>SPDK_NVMF_TRANSPORT_REGISTER</code>, have been added which enable registering out of tree transports.</p>
<p>Add <code><a class="el" href="nvmf_8h.html#ac796e8f25381f344119ef0f44c2a017c" title="Stop accepting new connections at the provided address.">spdk_nvmf_tgt_stop_listen()</a></code> that can be used to stop listening for incoming connections for specified target and trid. Listener is not stopped implicitly upon destruction of a subsystem any more.</p>
<p>A custom NVMe admin command handler has been added which allows the user to use the real drive attributes from one of the target NVMe drives when reporting drive attributes to the initiator. This handler can be enabled via the <code>nvmf_set_config</code> RPC. Note: In a future version of SPDK, this handler will be enabled by default.</p>
<p>The SPDK target and initiator both now include compare-and-write functionality with one caveat. If using the RDMA transport, the target expects the initiator to send both the compare command and write command either with, or without inline data. The SPDK initiator currently respects this requirement, but this note is included as a flag for other initiators attempting compatibility with this version of SPDK.</p>
<p>The <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__ctrlr__opts.html" title="NVMe controller initialization options.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_opts</a></code> struct has been extended with new field <code>transport_ack_timeout</code> which allows to configure transport ACK timeout. Applicable for RDMA transport only.</p>
<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>A new RPC, <code>bdev_zone_block_create</code>, enables creating an emulated zoned bdev on top of a standard block device.</p>
<p>A new RPC, <code>bdev_ocssd_create</code>, enables creating an emulated zoned bdev on top of an Open Channel SSD.</p>
<p>A new RPC, <code>blobfs_set_cache_size</code>, enables managing blobfs cache size.</p>
<p>A new RPC, <code>env_dpdk_get_mem_stats</code>, has been added to facilitate reading DPDK related memory consumption stats. Please see the env_dpdk section above for more details.</p>
<p>A new RPC, <code>framework_get_reactors</code>, has been added to retrieve a list of all reactors.</p>
<p><code>bdev_ftl_create</code> now takes a <code>base_bdev</code> argument in lieu of <code>trtype</code>, <code>traddr</code>, and <code>punits</code>.</p>
<p><code>bdev_nvme_set_options</code> now allows users to disable I/O submission batching with the <code>-d</code> flag</p>

<h2>scsi</h2>
<p><code>spdk_scsi_lun_get_dif_ctx</code> now takes an additional argument of type <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__scsi__task.html">spdk_scsi_task</a></code>.</p>
<h2>sock</h2>
<p>Added spdk_sock_writev_async for performing asynchronous writes to sockets. This call will never return EAGAIN, instead queueing internally until the data has all been sent. This can simplify many code flows that create pollers to continue attempting to flush writes on sockets.</p>
<p>Added <code>impl_name</code> parameter in spdk_sock_listen and spdk_sock_connect functions. Users may now specify the sock layer implementation they'd prefer to use. Valid implementations are currently "vpp" and "posix" and NULL, where NULL results in the previous behavior of the functions.</p>
<h2>thread</h2>
<p><code>spdk_thread_send_msg</code> now returns int indicating if the message was successfully sent.</p>
<p>A new function <code>spdk_thread_send_critical_msg</code>, has been added to support sending a single message from a context that may be interrupted, e.g. a signal handler.</p>
<p>Two new functions, <code>spdk_poller_pause</code>, and <code>spdk_poller_resume</code>, have been added to give greater control of pollers to the application owner.</p>
<h2>util</h2>
<p><code>spdk_pipe</code>, a new utility for buffering data from sockets or files for parsing has been added. The public API is available at <code><a class="el" href="pipe_8h.html" title="A pipe that is intended for buffering data between a source, such as a socket, and a sink,...">include/spdk/pipe.h</a></code>.</p>
<h2>bdev</h2>
<p>Added spdk_bdev_io_get_nvme_fused_status function for translating bdev_io status to NVMe status code for fused compare-and-write operation.</p>
<p>Added spdk_bdev_get_acwu function for getting block device atomic compare and write unit size.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v19-10"></a>
v19.10: Zoned bdev API, Opal bdev, NVMe character devices</h1>
<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>Many of SPDK's RPCs were renamed to be more consistent and intuitive in this release. The old names will continue to function, but will display a deprecation warning.</p>
<p>Added optional parameters '&ndash;arbitration-burst' and '&ndash;low/medium/high-priority-weight' to 'bdev_nvme_set_options' RPC method.</p>
<p>Added optional parameter '&ndash;md-size' to 'construct_null_bdev' RPC method.</p>
<p>Added optional parameters '&ndash;dif-type' and '&ndash;dif-is-head-of-md' to 'construct_null_bdev' RPC method.</p>
<p>Added <code>blobfs_detect</code> RPC method to detect whether a blobfs exists on given bdev.</p>
<p>Added <code>blobfs_create</code> RPC method to build blobfs on given bdev.</p>
<p>Added <code>blobfs_mount</code> RPC method to mount blobfs on given bdev to a host path by FUSE. Then on the host path, user can directly do some file operations which will be mapped to blobfs.</p>
<h2>bdev</h2>
<p>Added new parameter <code>cdw0</code> to <code><a class="el" href="bdev__module_8h.html#a3341d564a521b3e7874f72fc1390f043" title="Complete a bdev_io with an NVMe status code and DW0 completion queue entry.">spdk_bdev_io_complete_nvme_status()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="bdev_8h.html#ae7e1bf90f44f042c2b2ad463b8667735" title="Get the status of bdev_io as an NVMe status code and command specific completion queue value.">spdk_bdev_io_get_nvme_status()</a></code> that allows setting/getting the NVMe completion queue DW0 entry. This allows vendor specific IO commands to return commmand specific completion info back to the initiator.</p>
<p>Added <code><a class="el" href="bdev_8h.html#ab5775a23cadb2eb1d5381dc105577a37" title="Get the write unit size for this bdev.">spdk_bdev_get_write_unit_size()</a></code> function for retrieving required number of logical blocks for write operation.</p>
<p>New zone-related fields were added to the result of the <code>get_bdevs</code> RPC call:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zoned</code>: indicates whether the device is zoned or a regular block device</li>
<li><code>zone_size</code>: number of blocks in a single zone</li>
<li><code>max_open_zones</code>: maximum number of open zones</li>
<li><code>optimal_open_zones</code>: optimal number of open zones</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>zoned</code> field is a boolean and is always present, while the rest is only available for zoned bdevs.</p>
<p>A new <code>spdk_bdev_open_ext</code> function has been added and <code>spdk_bdev_open</code> function has been deprecated. The new open function introduces requirement to provide callback function that will be called by asynchronous event such as bdev removal. <code>spdk_bdev_open_ext</code> function takes bdev name as an argument instead of bdev structure to avoid a race condition that can happen when the bdev is being removed between a call to get its structure based on a name and actually openning it.</p>
<p>New 'resize' event has been added to notify about change of block count property of block device. Event is delivered only if block device was opened with <code>spdk_bdev_open_ext</code> function.</p>
<h2>bdev zone</h2>
<p>Added new public header for zoned bdev. Zoned bdev is an extension of the bdev interface.</p>
<p><code><a class="el" href="bdev__zone_8h.html#ad5e6fcc674d5ebe932e2b2dcaa28f9b5" title="Get device zone size in logical blocks.">spdk_bdev_get_zone_size()</a></code>, <code><a class="el" href="bdev__zone_8h.html#a7739e6335f06de1565e50d3afc247aa0" title="Get device maximum number of open zones.">spdk_bdev_get_max_open_zones()</a></code>, <code><a class="el" href="bdev__zone_8h.html#aa50981e9f75708e66f7174c96cf396f8" title="Get device optimal number of open zones.">spdk_bdev_get_optimal_open_zones()</a></code> APIs were added for retrieving zoned device information. <code><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#ga01f2a4fd5da187f568381fa3c55f603c" title="Submit a get_zone_info request to the bdev.">spdk_bdev_get_zone_info()</a></code> API was added for retrieving information about zones in zoned device. Added <code><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#ga9220b3c7c3f9591cfdfd73977ee69f91" title="Submit a zone_management request to the bdev.">spdk_bdev_zone_management()</a></code> API for changing zone state. <code><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#ga17d6c2c7f25d21c5d2cdfb6e187e2033" title="Submit a zone_append request to the bdev.">spdk_bdev_zone_append()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#gab8a2fd5a40daa3d36c15b3f92c9a81a7" title="Submit a zone_append request with metadata to the bdev.">spdk_bdev_zone_append_with_md()</a></code> APIs were added for appending data to a zone. Added <code>spdk_bdev_io_get_append location()</code> function for retrieving append location for I/O. Added <code><a class="el" href="bdev_8h.html#a2e334778f2dfb469e2f96bcd42c6343b" title="Checks if bdev supports zoned namespace semantics.">spdk_bdev_is_zoned()</a></code> function for checking if bdev supports zoned namespace semantics.</p>
<h2>bdev opal</h2>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: A new opal bdev has been added to support management of NVMe self-encrypting drives through the Opal specification. Users can create opal bdevs from an NVMe namespace bdev, if the controller containing that namespace supports Opal. Currently this is only supported for namespace ID=1. The following RPCs have been added to support Opal: <code>bdev_nvme_opal_init</code>, <code>bdev_nvme_opal_revert</code>, <code>bdev_opal_create</code>, <code>bdev_opal_delete</code>, <code>bdev_opal_get_info</code>, <code>bdev_opal_new_user</code>, <code>bdev_opal_set_lock_state</code>. It does not yet support recreating the opal bdevs after application restart. This bdev module should be considered very experimental, and the RPCs may change significantly in future releases.</p>
<h2>delay bdev</h2>
<p>The <code>bdev_delay_update_latency</code> has been added to allow users to update a latency value for a given delay bdev.</p>
<h2>compress bdev</h2>
<p>A new RPC <code>bdev_compress_get_orphans</code> has been added to list compress bdevs that were not loaded due to a missing pm metadata file. In this state they can only be deleted.</p>
<h2>null bdev</h2>
<p>Metadata support has been added to Null bdev module.</p>
<p>Protection information support has been added to Null bdev module.</p>
<h2>nvme</h2>
<p>Added <code>no_shn_notification</code> to NVMe controller initialization options, users can enable it for NVMe controllers. When the option is enabled, the controller will not do the shutdown process and just disable the controller, users can start their application later again to initialize the controller to the ready state.</p>
<p>A controller flag <code>SPDK_NVME_CTRLR_WRR_SUPPORTED</code> was added to indicate the controller can support weighted round robin arbitration feature with submission queue.</p>
<p>Added <code>arbitration_burst</code> option for arbitration feature, and added three <code>low/medium/high_priority_weight</code> options for weighted round robin arbitration.</p>
<p>Added <code>spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_write_uncorrectable</code>.</p>
<p>Added new error handling and reporting functionality. This includes several new API functions to facilitate applications recovering when a qpair or controller fails.</p>
<p><code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_reconnect_io_qpair</code> - Reconnects a failed I/O qpair. <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_set_trid</code> - Sets the trid of an existing controller. Can be used to change the trid for failover cases. <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_is_failed</code> - Returns the failed state of a controller. <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_fail</code> - Forces a controller into a failed state.</p>
<p>Modified the return behavior of several API functions to better indicate to applications when a qpair is failed. This list of functions includes:</p>
<p><code>spdk_nvme_qpair_process_completions</code> <code>spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_*</code> <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_process_admin_completions</code> <code>spdk_nvme_ctrlr_cmd_*</code></p>
<p>These functions now return -ENXIO when the qpair or controller on which they operate is failed.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: Added NVMe character device support to allow to create NVMe device nodes in Linux kernel for controller as well as for namespace and process ioctl requests as usual from linux environment.</p>
<h2>nvmf</h2>
<p>The <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_create</code> function now accepts an object of type <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__target__opts.html">spdk_nvmf_target_opts</a></code> as its only parameter. This new structure contains the max_subsystems parameter previously passed into that function.</p>
<p>A new public API function <code>spdk_nvmf_get_tgt</code> has been added which allows users to retrieve a pointer to an <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt</code> object by supplying its name. In the special case where an RPC or application only creates a single target, this function can accept a null name parameter and will return the only available target.</p>
<p>The majority of the NVMe-oF RPCs now accept an optional tgt_name parameter. This will allow those RPCs to work with applications that create more than one target.</p>
<p>Three new NVMe-oF RPCs have been added <code>nvmf_create_target</code>, <code>nvmf_delete_target</code>, and <code>nvmf_get_targets</code>. These new RPCs provide a basic interface for managing multiple target objects. In SPDK the target object defines a unique discovery service. As of this release, these RPCs are not intended to be used with the in-tree SPDK target applications, spdk_tgt and nvmf_tgt, which use a single, global target structure. As such, they are not included in scripts/rpc.py</p>
<p>Three new header functions have also been added to help deal with multiple targets. <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_get_name</code> takes a target pointer as an argument and returns its human readable name. <code>spdk_nvmf_get_first_target</code> takes no arguments and returns the first target in the global list. <code>spdk_nvmf_get_next_tgt</code> takes a target pointer as an argument and returns the next one in the global list.</p>
<p>The <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_accept</code> takes additional argument allowing to pass arbitrary context information to the <code>new_qpair</code> callback. This will simplify the code when having multiple nvmf targets or when retrieving the context information from globals is not suitable.</p>
<h2>blobstore</h2>
<p>A new <code>spdk_bdev_create_bs_dev_from_desc</code> function has been added and <code>spdk_bdev_create_bs_dev</code> function has been deprecated. The new create function can cowork with <code>spdk_bdev_open_ext</code> function, which provides callback function that will be called by asynchronous event such as bdev removal.</p>
<h2>blobfs_bdev</h2>
<p>A new blobfs module <code>bdev</code> has been added to simplify the operations of blobfs on bdev.</p>
<p>Function <code>spdk_blobfs_bdev_detect</code> is added to detect whether blobfs exists on the given block device.</p>
<p>Function <code>spdk_blobfs_bdev_create</code> is added to create a blobfs on the given block device.</p>
<p>Function <code>spdk_blobfs_bdev_mount</code> is added to mount a blobfs on the given block device to a host path by FUSE. Then, a new thread is created dedicatedly for one mountpoint to handle FUSE request by blobfs API.</p>
<h2>build</h2>
<p>Option to build FUSE components into blobfs_bdev module for mounting a blobfs filesystem. It requires the installation of libfuse3. By default, it is disabled. And it will be enabled if run <code>./configure</code> with <code>--with-fuse</code> option.</p>
<h2>iSCSI</h2>
<p>Portals may no longer be associated with a cpumask. The scheduling of connections is moving to a more dynamic model.</p>
<p>An new RPC <code>iscsi_portal_group_set_auth</code> has been added to set CHAP authentication for discovery sessions specific for the existing iSCSI portal group. This RPC overwrites the setting by the global parameters for the iSCSI portal group.</p>
<h2>socket</h2>
<p>Added <code>spdk_sock_is_connected</code> to check whether the socket is currently connected. <code>spdk_sock_group_poll</code> now returns number of events on success.</p>
<h2>env</h2>
<p>Added <code><a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a53e5710a5ece84d2d821b91351892da4" title="Undo spdk_pci_device_claim().">spdk_pci_device_unclaim()</a></code> function to cleanup pci claim file.</p>
<h2>event</h2>
<p><code>framework_start_init</code> RPC no longer stops the application on error during initialization.</p>
<h2>DPDK</h2>
<p>Updated DPDK submodule to DPDK 19.08.</p>
<h2>ocf</h2>
<p>Updated OCF submodule to OCF v19.06</p>
<p>Along with update, new cache mode 'write only' was added.</p>
<p>New cache modes added to use via RPC, wi - write invalidate and wa - write around.</p>
<p>New version of OCF provides fully asynchronous management API.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v19-07"></a>
v19.07: NVMe-oF FC Transport, VMD, NVMe-oF Persistent reservations, Bdev I/O with separate metadata</h1>
<h2>ftl</h2>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: Added ability to mirror writes to persistent write buffer cache to allow for recovery from dirty shutdown event.</p>
<p>Added handling of Asynchronous Nand Management Events (ANM).</p>
<h2>vmd</h2>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: Added Intel Volume Management Device (VMD) driver. VMD is an integrated controller inside the CPU PCIe root complex. It enables virtual HBAs for the connected NVMe SSDs. <code><a class="el" href="vmd_8h.html#a8ab093f9cdad46a637fac6aa07739ace" title="Enumerate VMD devices and hook them into the spdk pci subsystem.">spdk_vmd_init()</a></code> enumerates NVMe SSDs behind VMD device and hook them into SPDK PCI subsystem. <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a225bbc386ec518ae21bd5536f21db45d" title="Enumerate the bus indicated by the transport ID and attach the userspace NVMe driver to each device f...">spdk_nvme_probe()</a></code> or <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ae26375a74c2c935ec32f0c41a7ed93df" title="Connect the NVMe driver to the device located at the given transport ID.">spdk_nvme_connect()</a></code> can be used to connect NVMe driver to the device located at the given transport ID.</p>
<p>To obtain transport ID of NVMe SSD behind VMD <code>spdk_lspci</code> can be used.</p>
<p>Current implementation does not support hotplug.</p>
<h2>blobfs</h2>
<p>Blobfs file asynchronous operations were added to public APIs.</p>
<h2>util</h2>
<p>A new file API <code>spdk_posix_file_load</code> was added to load file content into a data buffer.</p>
<p>New APIs <code>spdk_dif_ctx_set_data_offset</code>, <code>spdk_dif_verify_stream</code>, <code>spdk_dif_get_range_with_md</code>, <code>spdk_dif_get_length_with_md</code> have been added, and existing APIs <code>spdk_dif_ctx_init</code>, <code>spdk_dif_set_md_interleave_iovs</code>, and <code>spdk_dif_generate_stream</code> have been refined to insert or strip DIF by stream fasion with any alignment.</p>
<p>New APIs <code>spdk_dif_ctx_set_remapped_init_ref_tag</code>, <code>spdk_dif_remap_ref_tag</code>, and <code>spdk_dix_remap_ref_tag</code> have been added to remap DIF reference tag.</p>
<p>New APIs <code>spdk_dif_update_crc32c</code> and <code>spdk_dif_update_crc32c_stream</code> have been added to compute CRC-32C checksum for extended LBA payload.</p>
<p>Bdevperf and bdevio applications now support starting tests with application specific RPCs. Please see helper Python scripts in their respective directories. This is a move towards simpler RPC-only configuration for all main and auxiliary applications.</p>
<p>Legacy INI style configuration for SPDK applications will become deprecated in SPDK 19.10, and removed in SPDK 20.01. Please consider moving to JSON-RPC configuration files and/or RPC driven run-time configuration.</p>
<h2>nvmf</h2>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: A Fibre Channel transport that supports Broadcom HBAs has been added. This depends on the FC HBA driver at <a href="https://github.com/ecdufcdrvr/bcmufctdrvr">https://github.com/ecdufcdrvr/bcmufctdrvr</a>. See <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/nvmf.html#nvmf_fc_transport">the documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Persistent reservation emulation has been added to the NVMe-oF target. Persistent reservation state is stored in a JSON file on the local filesystem between target restart. To support this, an optional parameter to the RPC method <code>nvmf_subsystem_add_ns</code> called <code>--ptpl-file</code> was added. This allows the user to specify which file to store the persistent reservation state in. Note that this is done per namespace.</p>
<p>The c2h success optimization under which a command capsule response is not sent for reads is turned on by default. A config knob was added to allow disabling the optimization. This will mostly be used for integration testing with 5.0.x kernels while some compatibility fixes make their way down the pipeline for 5.1.x kernels.</p>
<p>The sock priority setting of the TCP connection owned by the tcp transport is added. It is used to optimize the TCP connection performance under designated traffic classes. And the priority is used to differeniate the sock priority between SPDK NVMe-oF TCP target application and other TCP based applications.</p>
<p>Shared receive queue can now be disabled even for NICs that support it using the <code>nvmf_create_transport</code> RPC method parameter <code>no_srq</code>. The actual use of a shared receive queue is predicated on hardware support when this flag is not used.</p>
<p>spdk_nvmf_get_optimal_poll_group was added, which is used to return the optimal poll group for the qpair. And <code>ConnectionScheduler</code> configuration is added into the [Nvmf] section in etc/spdk/nvmf.conf.in to demonstrate how to configure the connection scheduling strategy among different spdk threads.</p>
<p>Added infrastructure to retrieve global and per poll group NVMf statistics.</p>
<p>DIF strip and insert is now supported for TCP transport. When it is enabled, DIF setting is not exposed to the NVMe-oF initiator, and DIF is attached into data for write I/O and stripped from data for read I/O.</p>
<p>Added a field <code>dif_insert_or_strip</code> to struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__transport__opts.html">spdk_nvmf_transport_opts</a>, and updated the related rpc function nvmf_create_transport to make this configurable parameter available to users. The <code>dif_insert_or_strip</code> is relevant for TCP transport for now and used to configure the DIF strip and insert.</p>
<p>Added infrastructure to retrieve NVMf transport statistics.</p>
<h2>notify</h2>
<p>The function <code>spdk_notify_get_types()</code> and <code>spdk_notify_get_events()</code> were renamed to <code>spdk_notify_foreach_type()</code> and <code>spdk_notify_foreach_event()</code>, respectively. And update type name of callback accordingly.</p>
<h2>bdev</h2>
<p>The format of the data returned by the get_bdevs_iostat RPC has changed to make it easier to parse. It now returns an object with a "ticks" object and "bdevs" array with the per-bdev statistics.</p>
<p>A new bdev module <code>delay</code> has been added which simulates a drive latency when placed on top of a Null bdev. This module is intended only for testing and can be created using the new RPC <code>bdev_delay_create</code>. That RPC takes the name of the underlying bdev as well as average and p99 latency arguments for both read and write operations. Average latency is defined as a value close to what you would expect a perf tool such as FIO to report back as the mean latency of all I/O submitted to the drive. p99 latency is defined as the value one would expect the drive to see the slowest 1% of I/O report. For underlying drives with already significant latency, the latency values provided to the drive will be additive. This should be taken into account if trying to achieve an artificial latency on top of an nvme drive or aio device.</p>
<p>DIF reference tag remapping is now supported for partition type virtual bdev modules. When using partition type virtual bdevs, block address space is remapped during I/O processing and DIF reference tag is remapped accordingly.</p>
<p>Added spdk_bdev_*_with_md() functions allowing for IO with metadata being transferred in separate buffer. To check support for separatate metadata, use <a class="el" href="bdev_8h.html#ac8c880555f4d66991c1fd9dbd3abaf4f" title="Query whether metadata is interleaved with block data or separated from block data.">spdk_bdev_is_md_separate()</a>.</p>
<p>All bdevs now have a UUID. For devices whose backing hardware does not provide a UUID, one is automatically generated. Across runs of SPDK, bdevs whose UUID is automatically generated may change.</p>
<p>A new virtual bdev module <code>compress</code> has been added to provide compression services on top of a thinly provisioned logical volume. See documentation for complete details.</p>
<h2>nvme</h2>
<p>Added an optional parameter <code>--io-queue-requests</code> to RPC <code>set_bdev_nvme_options</code>, which can be used to change the number of requests allocated for one NVMe I/O queue. For very big I/O size, e.g. 128MiB, with this option user will not get an error due to limited requests in NVMe driver layer.</p>
<p>Added <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#abb7ae9abf97b7c6b57777d06eaa1258a" title="Get the transport ID for a given NVMe controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_get_transport_id()</a> to get the transport ID from a previously attached controller.</p>
<p>Nvme Opal library spdk_opal_cmd deprecated. Adding seperate command APIs. NVMe Opal library add support for activating locking SP which will make the transaction from "Manufactured-Inactive" state to "Manufactured" state. Upon successfully invoking of this method, lock and unlock features will be enabled. NVMe Opal library add support for locking/unlocking range and list locking range info. NVMe opal library add support for multiuser. Admin can enable user and add user to specific locking range and the user can lock/unlock his range.</p>
<p>Added <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a8c00b191b38472b57b06f3f394353ad3" title="Send the given NVM I/O command, I/O buffers, lists and all to the NVMe controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_io_cmd_raw_no_payload_build()</a> allowing a caller to pass a completely formed command to an NVMe submission queue (buffer addresses and all). This is supported on the PCIe transport only.</p>
<p>Added spdk_nvme_get_ctrlr_registers() to return a pointer to the virtual address of the NVMe controller registers. This is supported on the PCIe transport only.</p>
<p>Added additional options to the spdk_nvme_ctrlr_alloc_qpair() option parameter structure to allow caller to override the virtual and optionally physical address of the submission and completion queue pair to be created. This is supported on the PCIe transport only.</p>
<p>Added <code>disable_error_logging</code> to struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__ctrlr__opts.html" title="NVMe controller initialization options.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_opts</a>, which disables logging of failed requests. By default logging is enabled.</p>
<p>Added <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ac06275147a2cbb800440686b8ba9a73b" title="Prints (SPDK_NOTICELOG) the contents of an NVMe submission queue entry (command).">spdk_nvme_qpair_print_command()</a>, <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ad4b2335194f9c4c24a5e2c15a9432f4a" title="Prints (SPDK_NOTICELOG) the contents of an NVMe completion queue entry.">spdk_nvme_qpair_print_completion()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a5f179ad680512c168148e13aa74b3f4b" title="Given NVMe status, return ASCII string for that error.">spdk_nvme_cpl_get_status_string()</a>. Allowing for easier display of error messages.</p>
<p>Added support for NVMe Sanitize command.</p>
<h2>env</h2>
<p>The parameter <code>free_space</code> has been added to <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a96a046de83d31127e79a7b16760b4776" title="Queue the array of objects (with length count) on the ring.">spdk_ring_enqueue()</a> to wait when the ring is almost full and resume when there is enough space available in the ring.</p>
<p>A new API <code>spdk_mempool_lookup</code> has been added to lookup the memory pool created by the primary process.</p>
<p>Added <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#ac98526545d85af08018dcbaebca8c49c" title="Begin iterating over enumerated PCI device by calling this function to get the first PCI device.">spdk_pci_get_first_device()</a> and <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#ad5292c669ec570b15694bfd1952f0868" title="Continue iterating over enumerated PCI devices.">spdk_pci_get_next_device()</a> to allow iterating over PCI devices detected by SPDK. Because of this, all SPDK APIs to attach/detach PCI devices are no longer thread safe. They are now meant to be called from only a single thread only, the same only that called <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a402ca8ae67be57c2c258a7a2bf22cfec" title="Initialize or reinitialize the environment library.">spdk_env_init()</a>. This applies to the newly added APIs as well.</p>
<h2>vpp</h2>
<p>SPDK now supports VPP version 19.04.2, up from VPP 18.01.</p>
<p>VPP socket abstraction now uses VPP Session API, instead of VLC (VPP Communications Library). This allows for better control over sessions and queues. Please see VPP documentation for more details: <a href="https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/HostStack">VPP Host Stack</a></p>
<h2>sock</h2>
<p>Add <a class="el" href="sock_8h.html#a8d38ca36abb4f475b362c485116678b9" title="Get the optimal sock group for this sock.">spdk_sock_get_optimal_sock_group()</a>, which returns the optimal sock group for this socket. When a socket is created, it is often assigned to a sock group using spdk_sock_group_add_sock so that a set of sockets can be polled more efficiently. For some network devices, it is optimal to assign particular sockets to specific sock groups. This API is intended to provide the user with that information.</p>

<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>Added thread_get_stats RPC method to retrieve existing statistics.</p>
<p>Added nvmf_get_stats RPC method to retrieve NVMf susbsystem statistics.</p>
<p>Response buffers for RPC requests are now always pre-allocated, which implies that all <a class="el" href="jsonrpc_8h.html#a22757fb7d0f34984e29b3fe311dfed01" title="Begin building a response to a JSON-RPC request.">spdk_jsonrpc_begin_result()</a> calls always succeed and return a valid buffer for JSON response. RPC calls no longer need to check if the buffer is non-NULL.</p>
<p>Added SPDK_RPC_REGISTER_ALIAS_DEPRECATED to help with deprecation process when renaming existing RPC. First time a deprecated alias is used, it will print a warning message.</p>
<p>RPC <code>get_rpc_methods</code> was renamed <code>rpc_get_methods</code>. The old name is still usable, but is now deprecated.</p>
<h2>blobstore</h2>
<p>A snapshot can now be deleted if there is only a single clone on top of it.</p>
<h2>build</h2>
<p>Preliminary support for cross compilation is now available. Targeting an older CPU on the same architecture using your native compiler can be accomplished by using the <code>--target-arch</code> option to <code>configure</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">./configure --target-arch=broadwell</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Additionally, some support for cross-compiling to other architectures has been added via the <code>--cross-prefix</code> argument to <code>configure</code>. To cross-compile, set CC and CXX to the cross compilers, then run configure as follows:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">./configure --target-arch=aarm64 --cross-prefix=aarch64-linux-gnu</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2>vhost</h2>
<p>A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in SPDK Vhost-SCSI target. A malicious client (e.g. a virtual machine) could send a carefully prepared, invalid I/O request to crash the entire SPDK process. All users of SPDK Vhost-SCSI target are strongly recommended to update. All SPDK versions &lt; 19.07 are affected.</p>
<p>By default, SPDK will now rely on upstream DPDK's rte_vhost instead of its fork located inside SPDK repo. The internal fork is still kept around to support older DPDK versions, but is considered legacy and will be eventually removed.</p>
<p><code>configure</code> will now automatically use the upstream rte_vhost if the used DPDK version is &gt;= 19.05.</p>

<h2>nvme</h2>
<p>Added asynchronous probe support. New APIs <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a02411bf7ae4827a350711e688316997e" title="Probe and add controllers to the probe context list.">spdk_nvme_probe_async()</a>, <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ae8a8762934973d124cbad92fce47a351" title="Connect the NVMe driver to the device located at the given transport ID.">spdk_nvme_connect_async()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#aedea919a47bdd811b604656e29e3fcef" title="Proceed with attaching contollers associated with the probe context.">spdk_nvme_probe_poll_async()</a> were added to enable this feature. <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a02411bf7ae4827a350711e688316997e" title="Probe and add controllers to the probe context list.">spdk_nvme_probe_async()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ae8a8762934973d124cbad92fce47a351" title="Connect the NVMe driver to the device located at the given transport ID.">spdk_nvme_connect_async()</a> return a context associated with the specified controllers.

<p>A new qpair creation option, delay_pcie_doorbell, was added. This can be passed to spdk_nvme_alloc_io_qpair(). This makes the I/O submission functions, such as spdk_nvme_ns_writev(), skip ringing the submission queue doorbell. Instead the doorbell will be rung as necessary inside <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#aa331d140870e977722bfbb6826524782" title="Process any outstanding completions for I/O submitted on a queue pair.">spdk_nvme_qpair_process_completions()</a>.

Two flags are currently tracked: SPDK_NVME_CTRLR_SGL_SUPPORTED SPDK_NVME_CTRLR_SECURITY_SEND_RECV_SUPPORTED</p>
<p>The NVMe hotplug poller is now able to detach devices hot-removed from the system via <code>/sys/bus/pci/devices/&lt;bdf&gt;/remove</code> and <code>/sys/bus/pci/devices/&lt;bdf&gt;/driver/unbind</code>.</p>
<p>Opal support was added for scan, take ownership, revert TPer, and dumping device info. The nvme_manage tool can be used to perform these operations. The public API functions are <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a5175d6805225d84d6e4aa4e0f1546c69" title="Receive security protocol data from controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_security_receive()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ada4ab089f73f3f43e9c5b8e6415e6f50" title="Send security protocol data to controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_security_send()</a>. This module should be considered experimental pending additional features and tests.</p>
<p>The NVMe-oF initiator is now able to transfer IO whose size is more than 128KiB if the corresponding NVMe-oF target allows.</p>
<h2>raid</h2>
<p>Added new strip_size_kb rpc param on create to replace the more ambiguous strip_size. The strip_size rpc param is deprecated.</p>
<p>Changed the raid bdev product_name from "Pooled Device" to "Raid Volume"</p>
<h2>thread</h2>

<h2>ocf</h2>
<p>Updated OCF submodule to OCF v19.3.2</p>
<p>Added support for many-to-one configuration for OCF bdev. Multiple core devices can now be cached on single cache device.</p>
<p>Added persistent metadata support, allowing to restore cache state after shutdown. During start of SPDK application, the devices are examined and if OCF metadata is present - appropriate OCF bdevs will be recreated.</p>
<p>Added Write-Back mode support. In this mode, data is first written to caching device and periodically synchronized to the core devices. Dirty data is saved as persistent metadata on cache device, allowing for safe restore during application restart. For more details please see OCF documentation: <a href="https://open-cas.github.io/cache_configuration.html">OpenCAS cache configuration</a></p>
<h2>NVMe-oF Target</h2>
<p>Support for per-device shared receive queues in the RDMA transport has been added. It is enabled by default for any device that supports it.</p>
<p>The size of a shared receive queue is defined by transport configuration file parameter <code>MaxSRQDepth</code> and <code>nvmf_create_transport</code> RPC method parameter <code>max_srq_depth</code>. Default size is 4096.</p>
<p>Add model number as parameter to construct_nvmf_subsystem (-d option), rather than using hardcoded define.</p>
<p>DIF passthrough feature has been added. DIF setting of the allocated bdevs is exposed to the NVMe-oF initiator and data with DIF from the NVMe-oF initiator is passed through to the allocated bdevs.</p>
<h2>env</h2>
<p>The <code>phys_addr</code> parameter in <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a668370523a786a75a7d08a8e8f4b28b9" title="Allocate dma/sharable memory based on a given dma_flg.">spdk_malloc()</a> and <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a49ad245dae3554cf96d62e9b2b0b1596" title="Allocate dma/sharable memory based on a given dma_flg.">spdk_zmalloc()</a> has been deprecated.

<h2>DPDK</h2>
<p>Dropped support for DPDK 17.07 and earlier, which SPDK won't even compile with right now.</p>
<p>Updated DPDK submodule to DPDK 19.02.</p>
<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>New <code>get_spdk_version</code> RPC method is introduced to get version info of the running SPDK application.</p>
<p>The <code>start_nbd_disk</code> RPC method now take nbd_device as an optional parameter. If nbd_device is specified, use that specified nbd device. If it's not specified, pick available one.</p>
<h2>iSCSI target</h2>
<p>DIF strip and insert is now supported. DIF settings are not exposed to the iSCSI initiator. DIF is attached into data for write I/O and stripped from data for read I/O.</p>
<h2>vhost</h2>
<p>Added experimental support for running with the external, upstream rte_vhost library. This can be enabled by configuring SPDK with an <code>--without-internal-vhost-lib</code> flag. The minimum supported rte_vhost version (DPDK version) is 19.05-rc1.</p>
<p>As a result of fuzz testing, a lot of data races in vhost-scsi LUN hotplug path were identified and fixed. Those data races could have potentially resulted in SPDK crashes, RPC hangs, or memory leaks if Vhost-SCSI LUN hotplug RPCs were executed while connected VMs were in the middle of restarting.</p>
<p>The SCSI target id in <code>add_vhost_scsi_lun</code> RPC is now optional. If <code>-1</code> is passed, the first unoccupied target id will be used.</p>
<h2>AIO</h2>
<p>AIO bdev module can now reap I/O completions directly from userspace, significantly improving the overall performance.</p>
<h2>blobfs</h2>
<p>Synchronous IO operations no longer use <a class="el" href="structspdk__io__channel.html" title="Represents a per-thread channel for accessing an I/O device.">spdk_io_channel</a>, but instead use spdk_fs_thread_ctx. The behavior is otherwise identical.</p>
<h2>OCF</h2>
<p>Added support for caching multiple bdevs using a single bdev as a cache.</p>
<h2>notify</h2>
<p>Added the notify library that provides a high performance local event bus between libraries. Example usage was added to bdev module, which reports notifications for added and removed bdevs via RPC.</p>
<h2>sock</h2>
<p>Added new API <a class="el" href="sock_8h.html#aec412e1537891ed4a02c24615df619b0" title="Read message from the given socket to the I/O vector array.">spdk_sock_readv()</a> to the sock library for performing vectored reads.</p>
<h2>event</h2>
<p>The function spdk_subsystem_init() no longer requires spdk_event as an argument.</p>
<p>Changed API of spdk_subsystem_config_json() to no longer be asynchronous.</p>
<h2>io_uring</h2>
<p>A bdev module that issues I/O to kernel block devices using the new io_uring Linux kernel API was added. This module requires liburing.</p>
<h2>build</h2>
<p>Options to easily compile with profile guided optimization have been added to <code>configure</code>. To use profile guided optimization with SPDK, run <code>./configure --with-pgo-capture</code>, build SPDK, then run a workload of your choosing. Then, simply run <code>./configure --with-pgo-enable</code> and recompile to build using the generated profile data. Profile guided optimization can yield very large performance improvements, especially on GCC 8 and clang 7. This may be combined with link time optimization which has been available under the <code>--enable-lto</code> configure option for several releases.</p>
<h2>compression bdev/reduce library</h2>
<p>Added "reduce" block compression scheme based on using SSDs for storing compressed blocks of storage and presistent memory for metadata. Please see <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/bdev.html">compression</a> for more details.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v19-01"></a>
v19.01: NVMe-oF TCP/IP Transport, Open Channel SSD Flash Translation Layer, Caching bdev based on OCF, ISA-L Support, DIF/DIX library</h1>
<h2>ocf bdev</h2>
<p>New virtual bdev module based on <a href="https://open-cas.github.io/">Open CAS Framework</a> has been added. This module allows for the use of one bdev to act as a high performance cache in front of another bdev. Please see <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#bdev_config_cas">documentation</a> for more details. Only write through mode is currently supported and this feature is considered experimental.</p>
<h2>event framework</h2>
<p>For <code>spdk_app_parse_args</code>, add return value to the callback which parses application specific command line parameters to protect SPDK applications from crashing by invalid values from user input.</p>
<p>By default, all SPDK applications will now reserve all hugepages at runtime. The pre-reserved memory size can be still set with <code>-s</code> or <code>--mem-size</code> option, although the default value was reduced down to 0.</p>
<p>A custom hugetlbfs directory can now be specified via <a class="el" href="structspdk__app__opts.html" title="Event framework initialization options.">spdk_app_opts</a>. This can be used to configure hugepages with different sizes, a different size limit, or different access permissions than the system's default hugepage pool. SPDK applications can specify a custom hugetlbfs mount with the <code>--huge-dir</code> option.</p>
<h2>environment</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="env_8h.html#ae73d54bd295c1d46aa9a45df17e6aa40" title="Get the physical address of a buffer.">spdk_vtophys()</a> has been refactored to accept length of the translated region as a new parameter. The function will now update that parameter with the largest possible value for which the memory is contiguous in the physical memory address space.</p>

Quoting from DPDK function this is based on: "This call is intended for tight loops which poll a shared resource or wait for an event. A short pause within the loop may reduce the power consumption."</p>
<p>A new public header file <a class="el" href="env__dpdk_8h.html" title="Encapsulated DPDK specific dependencies.">env_dpdk.h</a> has been introduced, and function spdk_env_dpdk_post_init is added into it.

<p>ISA-L has been added as an SPDK submodule. ISA-L is enabled by default on x86 architecture to accelerate algorithms such as CRC for iSCSI and NVMe-oF. Users may still disable ISA-L by explicitly passing &ndash;without-isal to the configure script.</p>
<h2>util</h2>
<p>A new uuid API <code>spdk_uuid_copy</code> was added to make a copy of the source uuid.</p>
<p>An new parameter <code>init_crc</code> representing the initial CRC value was added to <code>spdk_crc16_t10dif</code>. The parameter can be used to calculate a CRC value spanning multiple separate buffers.</p>
<p>New DIF APIs were added to generate and verify DIF by byte granularity for both DIF and DIX formats. Among them, DIF with copy APIs will be usable to emulate DIF operations such as DIF insert and strip.</p>
<p>Added <code>spdk_strtol</code> and <code>spdk_strtoll</code> to provide additional error checking around <code>strtol</code> and <code>strtoll</code>.</p>
<p>Added <code>spdk_sprintf_append_realloc</code> and <code>spdk_vsprintf_append_realloc</code> for appending a string with automatic buffer re-allocation.</p>
<h2>nvme</h2>
<p>Wrapper functions <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ada4ab089f73f3f43e9c5b8e6415e6f50" title="Send security protocol data to controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_security_send()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a5175d6805225d84d6e4aa4e0f1546c69" title="Receive security protocol data from controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_security_receive()</a> are introduced to support further security protocol development.</p>
<p>admin_timeout_ms was added to NVMe controller initialization options, users can change the default value when probing a controller.</p>
<p>Add two new fields "header_digest" and "data_digest" in struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__nvme__ctrlr__opts.html" title="NVMe controller initialization options.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_opts</a>, it will be used to enable the digest support for the NVMe/TCP transport.</p>
<p>Add a new TCP/IP transport(located in lib/nvme/nvme_tcp.c) in nvme driver. With this new transport, it can be used to connect the NVMe-oF target with the same TCP/IP support.</p>
<p>Added API, <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a39c91e2e6ae899f37b5a89c28a2207cf" title="Indicate whether a ctrlr handle is associated with a Discovery controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_is_discovery()</a>, to indicate whether the ctrlr arg refers to a Discovery Controller or not.</p>

<p>The RPC <code>construct_nvme_bdev</code> now allows a user to specify a source address and service id for the host to use when connecting to the controller backing the NVMe bdev.</p>
<h2>NVMe-oF Target</h2>
<p>The <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_opts</code> struct has been deprecated in favor of <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__transport__opts.html">spdk_nvmf_transport_opts</a></code>. Users will no longer be able to specify target wide I/O parameters. <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_listen</code> will also no longer implicitly initialize a transport with the default target options (since there are none). Instead, a user must manually instantiate the transport with <code>spdk_nvmf_transport_create</code> prior to calling <code>spdk_nvmf_tgt_listen</code>.</p>
<p>Related to the previous change, the rpc <code>set_nvmf_target_options</code> has been renamed to <code>set_nvmf_target_max_subsystems</code> to indicate that this is the only target option available for the user to edit.</p>
<p>Added fields <code>num_shared_buffers</code> and <code>buf_cache_size</code> in struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__nvmf__transport__opts.html">spdk_nvmf_transport_opts</a>, and also updated the related rpc function nvmf_create_transport, to make this configurable parameter available to users. The <code>num_shared_buffers</code> is used to configure the shared buffer numbers of the transport used by RDMA or TCP transport. <code>buf_cache_size</code> configures number of shared buffers to cache per poll group.</p>
<h2>nvmf</h2>
<p>Add a new TCP/IP transport (located in lib/nvmf/tcp.c). With this tranport, the SPDK NVMe-oF target can have a new transport, and can serve the NVMe-oF protocol via TCP/IP from the host.</p>
<p>Added optional mechanism to modify the RDMA transport's behavior when creating protection domains and registering memory. By default, the RDMA transport will use the ibverbs library to create protection domains and register memory. Using <code>spdk_nvme_rdma_init_hooks</code> will subvert that and use an existing registration.</p>
<h2>bdev</h2>
<p>Added <code>enable_bdev_histogram</code> and <code>get_bdev_histogram</code> RPC commands to allow gathering latency data for specified bdev. Please see <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#rpc_bdev_histogram">documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Added <code>required_alignment</code> field to <code><a class="el" href="structspdk__bdev.html">spdk_bdev</a></code>, that specifies an alignment requirement for data buffers associated with an <a class="el" href="structspdk__bdev__io.html">spdk_bdev_io</a>. Bdev layer will automatically double buffer any <a class="el" href="structspdk__bdev__io.html">spdk_bdev_io</a> that violates this alignment, before the <a class="el" href="structspdk__bdev__io.html">spdk_bdev_io</a> is submitted to the bdev module.</p>
<p>On shutdown, bdev unregister now proceeds in top-down fashion, with claimed bdevs skipped (these will be unregistered later, when virtual bdev built on top of the respective base bdev unclaims it). This allows virtual bdevs to be shut down cleanly as opposed to the previous behavior that didn't differentiate between hotremove and planned shutdown.</p>
<p>The <code>delete_bdev</code> RPC is now deprecated. Users should instead use the specific deletion RPC for the bdev type to be removed (i.e. delete_malloc_bdev).</p>
<p>Added support for separate bandwidth rate limits for read and write to QoS in bdev layer.</p>
<p>Bdev I/O statistics now track unmap opertations.</p>
<h2>logical volumes</h2>
<p>Logical volume bdev can now be marked as read only using <code>set_read_only_lvol_bdev</code> RPC. This allows for basing clones on top of lvol_bdev without first creating a snapshot.</p>
<p>Added option to change method for data erasure when deleting lvol or resizing down. Default of unmapping clusters can now be changed to writing zeroes or no operation.</p>
<p>Added option to change method for erasing data region on lvol store creation. Default of unmapping can now be changed to writing zeroes or no operation.</p>
<h2>log</h2>
<p>"trace flags" are now referred to as "log flags" in the SPDK log API. The set_trace_flag, clear_trace_flag and get_trace_flags RPCs are now deprecated, and set_log_flag, clear_log_flag and get_log_flags RPCs have been added.</p>
<h2>trace</h2>
<p>New <code>trace_record</code> application was added. It can be used to poll spdk trace shm file and append any new trace entries into another specified file. This can help retain those entries that would otherwise be overwritten in the shm file. See <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/nvmf_tgt_tracepoints.html#capture_trace_events">Capturing sufficient trace events</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Number of trace entries in circular buffer per lcore can now be assigned by starting SPDK app with argument "--num-trace-entries &lt;NUM&gt;" provided.</p>
<p>New <code>get_tpoint_group_mask</code> RPC was added to get current tpoint_group_mask, and each tpoint group status. New <code>enable_tpoint_group</code> and <code>disable_tpoint_group</code> RPC were added to enable or disable a specific tpoint group.</p>
<h2>ftl</h2>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: Added basic flash translation layer module allowing for using Open Channel SSDs as block devices. The module is split into the library (located in lib/ftl) and bdev_ftl (lib/bdev/ftl). See the <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/ftl.html">documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>vhost</h2>
<p>A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in the SPDK vhost target. A malicious vhost client (i.e. virtual machine) could carefully construct a circular descriptor chain which would result in a partial denial of service in the SPDK vhost target. These types of descriptor chains are now properly detected by the vhost target. All SPDK vhost users serving untrusted vhost clients are strongly recommended to upgrade. (Reported by Dima Stepanov and Evgeny Yakovlev.)</p>
<p>Vhost SCSI and Vhost Block devices can now accept multiple connections on the same socket file. Each connection (internally called a vhost session) will have access to the same storage, but will use different virtqueues, different features and possibly different memory.</p>
<h2>vhost scsi</h2>
<p>SCSI target hotremove can now be performed even without the VIRTIO_SCSI_F_HOTPLUG feature negotiated. Regardless of VIRTIO_SCSI_F_HOTPLUG support, the hotremoval will be still reported through SCSI sense codes.</p>
<h2>DPDK</h2>
<p>DPDK submodule was updated to DPDK 18.11. Note that SPDK does not fully leverage the new multi-process device hotplug yet and continues to work the same way it always did.</p>
<p>Dropped support for DPDK 16.07 and earlier, which SPDK won't even compile with right now.</p>
<h2>RPC</h2>
<p>The following RPC commands deprecated in the previous release are now removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>construct_virtio_user_scsi_bdev</li>
<li>construct_virtio_pci_scsi_bdev</li>
<li>construct_virtio_user_blk_bdev</li>
<li>construct_virtio_pci_blk_bdev</li>
<li>remove_virtio_scsi_bdev</li>
<li>construct_nvmf_subsystem</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The configure options <code>--with-raid</code> and <code>--without-raid</code> that were deprecated in the previous release are now removed.</p>
<h2>nbd</h2>
<p>Starting nbd using <code>spdk_nbd_start</code> is now performed asynchronously.</p>
<h2>net framework</h2>
<p>Net framework initialization and finish is now done asynchronously.</p>
<h2>rpc</h2>
<p>Added <code>spdk_rpc_is_method_allowed</code> function for checking whether method is permitted in a given state. Added <code>spdk_rpc_get_state</code> to check current state of RPC server. RPC <code>wait_subsystem_init</code> has been added to allow clients to block untill all subsystems are initialized.</p>
<h2>json rpc</h2>
<p>JSON RPC client is now running in non-blocking mode. Requests are sent and received during spdk_jsonrpc_client_poll. JSON RPC server can now recieve a callback on connection termination or server shutdown using <code>spdk_jsonrpc_conn_add_close_cb</code> and <code>spdk_jsonrpc_conn_del_close_cb</code>.</p>

v18.10: Dynamic memory allocation, Crypto Virtual Bdev, jsonrpc-client, SPDKCLI iSCSI and NVMe-oF support</h1>
<h2>nvme</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a0e7a6bb3ac85f99f936290f679399039" title="Send security protocol data to controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_cmd_security_send()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ae7bcc2decc2d4ce01b041601c5cdecea" title="Receive security protocol data from controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_cmd_security_receive()</a> were added to support sending or receiving security protocol data to or from nvme controller.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a8f3f5c5a738dc7ad7e3b2913bff4324c" title="Get the extended sector size, in bytes, of the given namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_get_extended_sector_size()</a> was added. This function includes the metadata size per sector (if any). <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a0d24c0b2b0b2a22b0c0af2ca2e157e04" title="Get the sector size, in bytes, of the given namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_get_sector_size()</a> still returns only the data size per sector, not including metadata.</p>
<p>New <code>send_nvme_cmd</code> RPC was added to allow sending NVMe commands directly to NVMe controller. See the <a href="http://spdk.io/doc/jsonrpc.html#rpc_send_nvme_cmd">send_nvme_cmd</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<h2>Build System</h2>
<p>New <code>configure</code> options, <code>--with-shared</code> and <code>--without-shared</code> [default], provide the capability to build, or not, SPDK shared libraries. This includes the single SPDK shared lib encompassing all of the SPDK static libs as well as individual SPDK shared libs corresponding to each of the SPDK static ones. Although the production of the shared libs conforms with conventional version naming practices, such naming does not at this time confer any SPDK ABI compatibility claims.</p>
<h2>bdev</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="bdev__module_8h.html#ae62dae3c4a41154aca74f37864ae82f9" title="Removes all alias from block device alias list.">spdk_bdev_alias_del_all()</a> was added to delete all alias from block device.</p>
<p>A new virtual bdev module has been added to perform at rest data encryption using the DPDK CryptoDev Framework. The module initially uses a software AESNI CBC cipher with experimental support for the Intel QAT hardware accelerator also currently implemented with support for CBC cipher. Future work may include additional ciphers as well as consideration for authentication.</p>
<p>The RAID virtual bdev module is now always enabled by default. The configure &ndash;with-raid and &ndash;without-raid options are now ignored and deprecated and will be removed in the next release.</p>
<p>Enforcement of bandwidth limits for quality of service (QoS) has been added to the bdev layer. See the new <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/jsonrpc.html#rpc_set_bdev_qos_limit">set_bdev_qos_limit</a> documentation for more details. The previous set_bdev_qos_limit_iops RPC method introduced at 18.04 release has been deprecated. The new set_bdev_qos_limit RPC method can support both bandwidth and IOPS limits.</p>
<p>spdk_bdev_config_json() and corresponding <code>get_bdevs_config</code> RPC was removed.</p>
<h2>Environment Abstraction Layer and Event Framework</h2>
<p>The size parameter of spdk_mem_map_translate is now a pointer. This allows the function to report back the actual size of the translation relative to the original request made by the user.</p>
<p>A new structure <a class="el" href="structspdk__mem__map__ops.html" title="A function table to be implemented by each memory map.">spdk_mem_map_ops</a> has been introduced to hold memory map related callbacks. This structure is now passed as the second argument of spdk_mem_map_alloc in lieu of the notify callback.</p>
<h2>DPDK 18.08</h2>
<p>The DPDK submodule has been updated to the DPDK 18.08 release. SPDK will now automatically utilize DPDK's dynamic memory management with DPDK versions &gt;= 18.05.1.</p>
<p>Hugepages can be still reserved with <code>[-s|--mem-size &lt;size&gt;]</code> option at application startup, but once we use them all up, instead of failing user allocations with -ENOMEM, we'll try to dynamically reserve even more. This allows starting SPDK with <code>--mem-size 0</code> and using only as many hugepages as it is really needed.</p>
<p>Due to this change, the memory buffers returned by <code>spdk_*malloc()</code> are no longer guaranteed to be physically contiguous.</p>
<h2>I/OAT</h2>
<p>I/OAT driver can now reinitialize I/OAT channels after encountering DMA errors.</p>
<h2>iscsi target</h2>
<p>Parameter names of <code>set_iscsi_options</code> and <code>get_iscsi_global_params</code> RPC method for CHAP authentication in discovery sessions have been changed to align with <code>construct_target_node</code> RPC method. Old names are still usable but will be removed in future release.</p>
<p><code>set_iscsi_discovery_auth</code> and <code>set_iscsi_target_node_auth</code> RPC methods have been added to set CHAP authentication for discovery sessions and existing target nodes, respectively.</p>
<p>The SPDK iSCSI target supports an AuthFile which can be used to load CHAP shared secrets when the iSCSI target starts. SPDK previously provided a default location for this file (<code>/usr/local/etc/spdk/auth.conf</code>) if none was specified. This default has been removed. Users must now explicitly specify the location of this file to load CHAP shared secrets from a file, or use the related iSCSI RPC methods to add them at runtime.</p>
<h2>iscsi initiator</h2>
<p>The SPDK iSCSI initiator is no longer considered experimental and becomes a first-class citizen among bdev modules. The basic usage has been briefly described in the bdev user guide: <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#bdev_config_iscsi">iSCSI bdev</a></p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The SPDK application framework can now parse long name command line parameters. Most single-character parameters have a long name equivalent now. See the <a href="https://spdk.io/doc/app_overview.html">Command Line Parameters</a> documentation for details or use the <code>--help</code> command line parameter to list all available params.</p>
<p>bdevperf <code>-s</code> param (io size) was renamed to <code>-o</code> as <code>-s</code> had been already used by existing apps for memory size.</p>
<p>bdevio can now accept all SPDK command line parameters. The config now has to be provided with <code>-c</code> or <code>--config</code> param.</p>
<p>The following ioat/perf and nvme/perf parameters were renamed as well: <code>-s</code> (io size) to <code>-o</code> <code>-d</code> (mem size) to <code>-s</code></p>
<p>The ReactorMask config file parameter has been deprecated. Users should use the -m or &ndash;cpumask command line option to specify the CPU core mask for the application.</p>
<p>Default config file pathnames have been removed from iscsi_tgt, nvmf_tgt and vhost. Config file pathnames may now only be specified using the -c command line option.</p>
<p>Users may no longer set DPDK_DIR in their environment to specify the location of the DPDK installation used to build SPDK. Using DPDK_DIR has not been the documented nor recommended way to specify the DPDK location for several releases, but removing it ensures no unexpected surprises for users who may have DPDK_DIR defined for other reasons. Users should just use the "configure" script to specify the DPDK location before building SPDK.</p>
<p>Although we know that many developers still use Python 2 we are officially switching to Python3 with requirement that all new code must be valid also for Python 2 up to the EOL which is year 2020.</p>
<p>Invoking interpreter explicitly is forbidden for executable scripts. There is no need to use syntax like "python ./scripts/rpc.py". All executable scripts must contain proper shebang pointing to the right interpreter. Scripts without shebang musn't be executable.</p>
<p>A Python script has been added to enable conversion of old INI config file to new JSON-RPC config file format. This script can be found at scripts/config_converter.py. Example how this script can be used: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">cat old_format.ini | scripts/config_converter.py &gt; new_json_format.json</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2>Sock</h2>
<p>Two additional parameters were added to spdk_sock_get_addr() for the server port and client port. These parameters are named "sport" and "cport" respectively.</p>
<h2>Virtio</h2>
<p>The following RPC commands have been deprecated:</p>
<ul>
<li>construct_virtio_user_scsi_bdev</li>
<li>construct_virtio_pci_scsi_bdev</li>
<li>construct_virtio_user_blk_bdev</li>
<li>construct_virtio_pci_blk_bdev</li>
<li>remove_virtio_scsi_bdev</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>construct_virtio_*</code> ones were replaced with a single <code>construct_virtio_dev</code> command that can create any type of Virtio bdev(s). <code>remove_virtio_scsi_bdev</code> was replaced with <code>remove_virtio_bdev</code> that can delete both Virtio Block and SCSI devices.</p>
<h2>Blobfs</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="blobfs_8h.html#a816f18c23723f7211b0a5a277904b202" title="Get the unique ID for the file.">spdk_file_get_id()</a> returning unique ID for the file was added.</p>
<h2>JSON</h2>
<p>Added jsonrpc-client C library intended for issuing RPC commands from applications.</p>
<p>Added API enabling iteration over JSON object:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="json_8h.html#a5fc65c7d1961c23a747b3e2aa2169f4a" title="Return JSON value asociated with key key_name.">spdk_json_find()</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Blobstore</h2>
<p>Blobstore I/O operations are now based on io_units, instead of blobstore page size. The io_unit size is now the same as the underlying block device's block size. Logical volumes built on a block device with 512B block size can now be used as boot devices in QEMU.</p>
<h2>SPDKCLI</h2>
<p>The SPDKCLI interactive command tool for managing SPDK is no longer considered experimental. Support for the iSCSI and NVMe-oF targets has been added.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v18-07"></a>

<h2>bdev</h2>
<p>A new public header file <a class="el" href="bdev__module_8h.html" title="Block Device Module Interface.">bdev_module.h</a> has been introduced to facilitate the development of new bdev modules. This header includes an interface for the <a class="el" href="structspdk__bdev__part.html">spdk_bdev_part</a> and spdk_bdev_part_base objects to enable the creation of multiple virtual bdevs on top of a single base bdev and should act as the primary API for module authors.</p>

<p>A mechanism for handling out of memory condition errors (ENOMEM) returned from I/O submission requests at the bdev layer has been added. See <a class="el" href="bdev_8h.html#acc4beee18ded7837fa92bd7c34e7ef2e" title="Add an entry into the calling thread&#39;s queue to be notified when an spdk_bdev_io becomes available.">spdk_bdev_queue_io_wait()</a>.</p>

This allows multiple callers to query I/O statistics without conflicting with each other. Existing users will need to adjust their code to record the previous I/O statistics to calculate the delta between calls.</p>
<p>I/O queue depth tracking and samples options have been added.

<h2>RAID module</h2>
<p>A new bdev module called "raid" has been added as experimental module which aggregates underlying NVMe bdevs and exposes a single raid bdev. Please note that vhost will not work with this module because it does not yet have support for multi-element io vectors.</p>
<h2>Log</h2>
<p>The debug log component flag available on several SPDK applications has been renamed from <code>-t</code> to <code>-L</code> to prevent confusion with tracepoints and to allow the option to be added to tools that already use <code>-t</code> to mean something else.</p>
<h2>Blobstore</h2>
<p>A new function, <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#aa75072ce1a5a9559fe2db0da30363ad4" title="Dump a blobstore&#39;s metadata to a given FILE in human-readable format.">spdk_bs_dump()</a>, has been added that dumps all of the contents of a blobstore to a file pointer. This includes the metadata and is very useful for debugging.</p>
<p>Two new operations have been added for thin-provisioned blobs. <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a3d1f1b56d9782997ef3e338879a2fa28" title="Allocate all clusters in this blob.">spdk_bs_inflate_blob()</a> will allocate clusters for all thinly provisioned regions of the blob and populate them with the correct data by reading from the backing blob(s). <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a7dee33b6b9df9b9a3d6b9957c71a779c" title="Remove dependency on parent blob.">spdk_bs_blob_decouple_parent()</a> works similarly, but will only allocate clusters that correspond to data in the blob's immediate parent. Clusters allocated to grandparents or that aren't allocated at all will remain thin-provisioned.</p>
<h2>BlobFS</h2>
<p>Changed the return type of <a class="el" href="blobfs_8h.html#ada4d09ddb42d39ba04b437193dc33d69" title="Truncate the file.">spdk_file_truncate()</a> from void to int to allow the propagation of <code>ENOMEM</code> errors.</p>
<h2>NVMe Driver</h2>
<p>The new API functions <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#acf6188764b8c71b2f64a74077d6bfabf" title="Inject an error for the next request with a given opcode.">spdk_nvme_qpair_add_cmd_error_injection()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ad720b23786450b5a2b2d7d65c6dd6b7c" title="Clear the specified NVMe command with error status.">spdk_nvme_qpair_remove_cmd_error_injection()</a> have been added for NVMe error emulation. Users can set a specified command to fail with a particular error status.</p>
<p>Changed the name <code>timeout_sec</code> parameter to <code>timeout_us</code> in <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#aecec86e033e0d13e6fc67ead61a7028d" title="Register for timeout callback on a controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_register_timeout_callback()</a>, and also changed the type from uint32_t to uint64_t. This will give users more fine-grained control over the timeout period.</p>
<p>Basic support for Open Channel SSDs was added. See <a class="el" href="nvme__ocssd_8h.html" title="NVMe driver public API extension for Open-Channel.">nvme_ocssd.h</a></p>
<h2>NVMe Over Fabrics</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="nvmf_8h.html#a21638f4d81002e93d410cd0d267f608c" title="Destroy an NVMe-oF target.">spdk_nvmf_tgt_destroy()</a> function is now asynchronous and takes a callback as a parameter.</p>

<h2>Build System</h2>
<p>The build system now generates a combined shared library (libspdk.so) that may be used in place of the individual static libraries (libspdk_*.a). The combined library includes all components of SPDK and is intended to make linking against SPDK easier. The static libraries are also still provided for users that prefer to link only the minimal set of components required.</p>
<h2>git pre-commit and pre-push hooks</h2>
<p>The pre-commit hook will run <code>scripts/check_format.sh</code> and verify there are no formating errors before allowing <code>git commit</code> to run. The pre-push hook runs <code>make CONFIG_WERROR=y</code> with and without <code>CONFIG_DEBUG=y</code> using both the gcc and clang compiler before allowing <code>git push</code> to run. Following each DEBUG build <code>test/unit/unittest.sh</code> is run and verified. Results are recorded in the <code>make.log</code> file.</p>
<p>To enable type: 'git config core.hooksPath .githooks'. To override after configuration use the <code>git --no-verify</code> flag.</p>
<h2>RPC</h2>
<p>The <code>start_nbd_disk</code> RPC method now returns the path to the kernel NBD device node rather than always returning <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2>DPDK 18.05</h2>
<p>The DPDK submodule has been rebased on the DPDK 18.05 release. DPDK 18.05 supports dynamic memory allocation, but due to some issues found after the DPDK 18.05 release, that support is not enabled for SPDK 18.07. Therefore, SPDK 18.07 will continue to use the legacy memory allocation model. The plan is to enable dynamic memory allocation after the DPDK 18.08 release which should fix these issues.</p>
<h2>Environment Abstraction Layer and Event Framework</h2>
<p>The <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a99549dc9905683f1dea50ff79d0c5651" title="Look up the translation of a virtual address in a memory map.">spdk_mem_map_translate()</a> function now takes a size parameter to indicate the size of the memory region. This can be used by environment implementations to validate the requested translation.</p>
<p>The I/O Channel implementation has been moved to its own library - lib/thread. The public API that was previously in spdk/io_channel.h is now in <a class="el" href="thread_8h.html" title="Thread.">spdk/thread.h</a> The file spdk/io_channel.h remains and includes <a class="el" href="thread_8h.html" title="Thread.">spdk/thread.h</a>.</p>
<p>spdk_reactor_get_tsc_stats was added to return interesting statistics for each reactor.</p>
<h2>IOAT</h2>
<p>IOAT for copy engine is disabled by default. It can be enabled by specifying the Enable option with "Yes" in <code>[Ioat]</code> section of the configuration file. The Disable option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v18-04"></a>
v18.04: Logical Volume Snapshot/Clone, iSCSI Initiator, Bdev QoS, VPP Userspace TCP/IP</h1>
<h2>vhost</h2>
<p>The SPDK vhost-scsi, vhost-blk and vhost-nvme applications have fixes to address the DPDK rte_vhost vulnerability <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1059">CVE-2018-1059</a>. Please see this <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1059">security advisory</a> for additional information on the DPDK vulnerability.</p>
<p>Workarounds have been added to ensure vhost compatibility with QEMU 2.12.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: Support for vhost-nvme has been added to the SPDK vhost target. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/vhost.html">vhost documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Unified Target Application</h2>
<p>A new unified SPDK target application, <code>spdk_tgt</code>, has been added. This application combines the functionality of several existing SPDK applications, including the iSCSI target, NVMe-oF target, and vhost target. The new application can be managed through the existing configuration file and <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/jsonrpc.html">JSON-RPC</a> methods.</p>
<h2>Env</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a5695d9dcc6f53a561f41c932a198853b" title="Get multiple elements from a memory pool.">spdk_mempool_get_bulk()</a> has been added to wrap DPDK rte_mempool_get_bulk().</p>
<p>New memory management functions <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a668370523a786a75a7d08a8e8f4b28b9" title="Allocate dma/sharable memory based on a given dma_flg.">spdk_malloc()</a>, <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a49ad245dae3554cf96d62e9b2b0b1596" title="Allocate dma/sharable memory based on a given dma_flg.">spdk_zmalloc()</a>, and <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a452d670d7188f883224574dfabc39f2c" title="Free buffer memory that was previously allocated with spdk_malloc() or spdk_zmalloc().">spdk_free()</a> have been added. These new functions have a <code>flags</code> parameter that allows the user to specify whether the allocated memory needs to be suitable for DMA and whether it should be shared across processes with the same shm_id. The new functions are intended to replace <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a0874731c44ac31e4b14d91c6844a87d1" title="Allocate a pinned memory buffer with the given size and alignment.">spdk_dma_malloc()</a> and related functions, which will eventually be deprecated and removed.</p>
<h2>Bdev</h2>
<p>A new optional bdev module interface function, <code>init_complete</code>, has been added to notify bdev modules when the bdev subsystem initialization is complete. This may be useful for virtual bdevs that require notification that the set of initialization examine() calls is complete.</p>
<p>The bdev layer now allows modules to provide an optional per-bdev UUID, which can be retrieved with the <a class="el" href="bdev_8h.html#add8565cdbf3d57697b67202b869a7beb" title="Get a bdev&#39;s UUID.">spdk_bdev_get_uuid()</a> function.</p>
<p>Enforcement of IOPS limits for quality of service (QoS) has been added to the bdev layer. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/jsonrpc.html#rpc_set_bdev_qos_limit_iops">set_bdev_qos_limit_iops</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<h2>RPC</h2>
<p>The <code>[Rpc]</code> configuration file section, which was deprecated in v18.01, has been removed. Users should switch to the <code>-r</code> command-line parameter instead.</p>
<p>The JSON-RPC server implementation now allows up to 32 megabyte responses, growing as needed; previously, the response was limited to 32 kilobytes.</p>
<h2>SPDKCLI</h2>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: New SPDKCLI interactive command tool for managing SPDK is available. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/spdkcli.html">SPDKCLI</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<h2>NVMe Driver</h2>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL: Support for WDS and RDS capable CMBs in NVMe controllers has been added. This support is experimental pending a functional allocator to free and reallocate CMB buffers.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a6c559063408299a4612fd2e62f97bc63" title="Get the UUID for the given namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_get_uuid()</a> has been added to allow retrieval of per-namespace UUIDs when available.</p>
<p>New API functions <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a59e69f39c7cb8a9e1c3e00af7804c8bd" title="Get the nsid of the first active namespace.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_get_first_active_ns()</a> and <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#abcd528b0df0a564c218dc2745c3af159" title="Get next active namespace given the previous nsid.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_get_next_active_ns()</a> have been added to iterate active namespaces, as well as <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#abbcdb6e7c22b0ef87ed927bf97952c19" title="Check whether the nsid is an active nv for the given NVMe controller.">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_is_active_ns()</a> to check if a namespace ID is active.</p>
<h2>NVMe-oF Target</h2>
<p>Namespaces may now be assigned unique identifiers via new optional <code>eui64</code> and <code>nguid</code> parameters to the <code>nvmf_subsystem_add_ns</code> RPC method. Additionally, the NVMe-oF target automatically exposes the backing bdev's UUID as the namespace UUID when available.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="nvmf_8h.html#aa10ac07a403de72643a5e9801e9fec0b" title="Remove a namespace from a subsytem.">spdk_nvmf_subsystem_remove_ns()</a> is now asynchronous and requires a callback to indicate completion.</p>
<h2>Blobstore</h2>
<p>A number of functions have been renamed:</p>
<ul>
<li>spdk_bs_io_write_blob() =&gt; <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a2835355d4266676fa6db5c987c506a77" title="Write data to a blob.">spdk_blob_io_write()</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The old names still exist but are deprecated. They will be removed in the v18.07 release.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a70993dda1206b4c0aaa76deb2b6fd13c" title="Resize a blob to &#39;sz&#39; clusters.">spdk_blob_resize()</a> is now an asynchronous operation to enable resizing a blob while I/O are in progress to that blob on other threads. An explicit <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a5acc48debefc30773518871e4f84480f" title="Sync a blob.">spdk_blob_sync_md()</a> is still required to sync the updated metadata to disk.</p>
<h2>Logical Volumes</h2>
<p>A new <code>destroy_lvol_bdev</code> RPC method to delete logical volumes has been added.</p>
<p>Lvols now have their own UUIDs which replace previous LvolStoreUUID_BlobID combination.</p>
<p>New Snapshot and Clone functionalities have been added. User may create Snapshots of existing Lvols and Clones of existing Snapshots. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/logical_volumes.html#lvol_snapshots">lvol snapshots</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<p>Resizing logical volumes is now supported via the <code>resize_lvol_bdev</code> RPC method.</p>
<h2>Lib</h2>
<p>A set of changes were made in the SPDK's lib code altering instances of calls to <code>exit()</code> and <code>abort()</code> to return a failure instead wherever reasonably possible.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="event_8h.html#a3901d9ed6c234d92296db9ec9252a0f5" title="Start the framework.">spdk_app_start()</a> no longer exit()'s on an internal failure, but instead returns a non-zero error status.</p>

<p>spdk_pci_get_device() has been deprecated and will be removed in SPDK v18.07.</p>
<h2>I/O Channels</h2>
<p>The prototype for <a class="el" href="thread_8h.html#a35c421accdc2a0a61bb7be916106293b" title="Callback function for a poller.">spdk_poller_fn()</a> has been modified; it now returns a value indicating whether or not the poller did any work. Existing pollers will need to be updated to return a value.</p>
<h2>iSCSI Target</h2>
<p>The SPDK iSCSI target now supports the fd.io Vector Packet Processing (VPP) framework userspace TCP/IP stack. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/iscsi.html#vpp">iSCSI VPP documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>iSCSI initiator</h2>
<p>An iSCSI initiator bdev module has been added to SPDK. This module should be considered experimental pending additional features and tests. More details can be found in lib/bdev/iscsi/README.</p>
<h2>PMDK</h2>
<p>The persistent memory (PMDK) bdev module is now enabled using <code>--with-pmdk</code> instead of <code>--with-nvml</code>. This reflects the renaming of the persistent memory library from NVML to PMDK.</p>
<h2>Virtio Block driver</h2>
<p>A userspace driver for Virtio Block devices has been added. It was built on top of the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/virtio.html">Virtio</a> library and can be managed similarly to the Virtio SCSI driver. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#bdev_config_virtio_blk">Virtio Block</a> reference for more information.</p>
<h2>Virtio with 2MB hugepages</h2>
<p>The previous 1GB hugepage limitation has now been lifted. A new <code>-g</code> command-line option enables SPDK Virtio to work with 2MB hugepages. See <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/virtio.html#virtio_2mb">2MB hugepages</a> for details.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v18-01"></a>
v18.01: Blobstore Thin Provisioning</h1>
<h2>Build System</h2>
<p>The build system now includes a <code>make install</code> rule, including support for the common <code>DESTDIR</code> and <code>prefix</code> variables as used in other build systems. Additionally, the prefix may be set via the configure <code>--prefix</code> option. Example: <code>make install prefix=/usr</code>.</p>
<h2>RPC</h2>
<p>A JSON RPC listener is now enabled by default using a UNIX domain socket at /var/tmp/spdk.sock. A -r option command line option has been added to enable an alternative UNIX domain socket location, or a TCP port in the format ip_addr:tcp_port (i.e. 127.0.0.1:5260). The Rpc configuration file section is now deprecated and will be removed in the v18.04 release.</p>
<h2>I/O Channels</h2>
<p><a class="el" href="thread_8h.html#a6b3e883ddce01ae8d93541304d1e9126" title="Register a poller on the current thread.">spdk_poller_register()</a> and <a class="el" href="thread_8h.html#a9c26cbd781063f5ee627d6aba2c73fe3" title="Unregister a poller on the current thread.">spdk_poller_unregister()</a> were moved from the event framework (<a class="el" href="event_8h.html" title="Event framework public API.">include/spdk/event.h</a>) to the I/O channel library (include/spdk/io_channel.h). This allows code that doesn't depend on the event framework to request registration and unregistration of pollers.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="thread_8h.html#aa7a2ca9bd0497544e852c65fd5263cd1" title="Call &#39;fn&#39; on each channel associated with io_device.">spdk_for_each_channel()</a> now allows asynchronous operations during iteration. Instead of immediately continuing the interation upon returning from the iteration callback, the user must call <a class="el" href="thread_8h.html#a4e87fc8c0fc870769c068a2752cdc359" title="Helper function to iterate all channels for spdk_for_each_channel().">spdk_for_each_channel_continue()</a> to resume iteration.</p>
<h2>Block Device Abstraction Layer (bdev)</h2>
<p>The poller abstraction was removed from the bdev layer. There is now a general purpose abstraction for pollers available in include/spdk/io_channel.h</p>
<h2>Lib</h2>
<p>A set of changes were made in the SPDK's lib code altering, instances of calls to <code>exit()</code> and <code>abort()</code> to return a failure instead wherever reasonably possible. This has resulted in return type changes of the API for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a402ca8ae67be57c2c258a7a2bf22cfec" title="Initialize or reinitialize the environment library.">spdk_env_init()</a> from type <code>void</code> to <code>int</code>.</li>
<li>spdk_mem_map_init() from type <code>void</code> to <code>int</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications making use of these APIs should be modified to check for a non-zero return value instead of relying on them to fail without return.</p>
<h2>NVMe Driver</h2>
<p>SPDK now supports hotplug for vfio-attached devices. But there is one thing keep in mind: Only physical removal events are supported; removing devices via the sysfs <code>remove</code> file will not work.</p>
<h2>NVMe-oF Target</h2>
<p>Subsystems are no longer tied explicitly to CPU cores. Instead, connections are handed out to the available cores round-robin. The "Core" option in the configuration file has been removed.</p>
<h2>Blobstore</h2>
<p>A number of functions have been renamed:</p>
<ul>
<li>spdk_bs_md_resize_blob() =&gt; <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a70993dda1206b4c0aaa76deb2b6fd13c" title="Resize a blob to &#39;sz&#39; clusters.">spdk_blob_resize()</a></li>

<p>Thin provisioning support has been added to the blobstore. It can be enabled by setting the <code>thin_provision</code> flag in struct <a class="el" href="structspdk__blob__opts.html">spdk_blob_opts</a> when calling <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a3c00efe656ca70fc5e8f2f477b8e48ed" title="Create a new blob with options on the given blobstore.">spdk_bs_create_blob_ext()</a>.</p>
<h2>NBD device</h2>
<p>The NBD application (test/lib/bdev/nbd) has been removed; Same functionality can now be achieved by using the test/app/bdev_svc application and start_nbd_disk RPC method. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#bdev_config_gpt">GPT</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<h2>FIO plugin</h2>
<p>SPDK <code>fio_plugin</code> now supports FIO 3.3. The support for previous FIO 2.21 has been dropped, although it still remains to work for now. The new FIO contains huge amount of bugfixes and it's recommended to do an update.</p>
<h2>Virtio library</h2>
<p>Previously a part of the bdev_virtio module, now a separate library. Virtio is now available via <code>spdk_internal/virtio.h</code> file. This is an internal interface to be used when implementing new Virtio backends, namely Virtio-BLK.</p>
<h2>iSCSI</h2>
<p>The MinConnectionIdleInterval parameter has been removed, and connections are no longer migrated to an epoll/kqueue descriptor on the master core when idle.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v17-10"></a>
v17.10: Logical Volumes</h1>
<h2>New dependencies</h2>
<p>libuuid was added as new dependency for logical volumes.</p>
<p>libnuma is now required unconditionally now that the DPDK submodule has been updated to DPDK 17.08.</p>
<h2>Block Device Abstraction Layer (bdev)</h2>
<p>An <a href="http://github.com/axboe/fio">fio</a> plugin was added that can route I/O to the bdev layer. See the <a href="https://github.com/spdk/spdk/tree/master/examples/bdev/fio_plugin/">plugin documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#ga680c9c302998f7b003e2476e35d9ae4b" title="Submit an unmap request to the block device.">spdk_bdev_unmap()</a> was modified to take an offset and a length in bytes as arguments instead of requiring the user to provide an array of SCSI unmap descriptors. This limits unmaps to a single contiguous range.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#gadc50b78fec7f69190d9139aff29a9043" title="Submit a write zeroes request to the bdev on the given channel.">spdk_bdev_write_zeroes()</a> was introduced. It ensures that all specified blocks will be zeroed out. If a block device doesn't natively support a write zeroes command, the bdev layer emulates it using write commands.</p>
<p>New API functions that accept I/O parameters in units of blocks instead of bytes have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#gaeec9efd151e2fb34ee3d22a1edbbb53f" title="Submit a read request to the bdev on the given channel.">spdk_bdev_read_blocks()</a>, <a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#ga55483d5ae010c514b37b976ad803b4b2" title="Submit a read request to the bdev on the given channel.">spdk_bdev_readv_blocks()</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The bdev layer now handles temporary out-of-memory I/O failures internally by queueing the I/O to be retried later.</p>
<h2>Linux AIO bdev</h2>
<p>The AIO bdev now allows the user to override the auto-detected block size.</p>
<h2>NVMe driver</h2>
<p>The NVMe driver now recognizes the NVMe 1.3 Namespace Optimal I/O Boundary field. NVMe 1.3 devices may report an optimal I/O boundary, which the driver will take into account when splitting I/O requests.</p>
<p>The HotplugEnable option in <code>[Nvme]</code> sections of the configuration file is now "No" by default. It was previously "Yes".</p>
<p>The NVMe library now includes a <a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a2640aeebb82108e9b507dcccb1e564c2" title="Get the controller with which this namespace is associated.">spdk_nvme_ns_get_ctrlr()</a> function which returns the NVMe Controller associated with a given namespace.</p>
<p>The NVMe library now allows the user to specify a host identifier when attaching to a controller. The host identifier is used as part of the Reservations feature, as well as in the NVMe-oF Connect command. The default host ID is also now a randomly-generated UUID, and the default host NQN uses the host ID to generate a UUID-based NQN.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ae26375a74c2c935ec32f0c41a7ed93df" title="Connect the NVMe driver to the device located at the given transport ID.">spdk_nvme_connect()</a> was added to allow the user to connect directly to a single NVMe or NVMe-oF controller.</p>
<h2>NVMe-oF Target (nvmf_tgt)</h2>
<p>The NVMe-oF target no longer requires any in-capsule data buffers to run, and the feature is now entirely optional. Previously, at least 4 KiB in-capsule data buffers were required.</p>
<p>NVMe-oF subsytems have a new configuration option, AllowAnyHost, to control whether the host NQN whitelist is enforced when accepting new connections. If no Host options have been specified and AllowAnyHost is disabled, the connection will be denied; this is a behavior change from previous releases, which allowed any host NQN to connect if the Host list was empty. AllowAnyHost is disabled by default.</p>
<p>NVMe-oF namespaces may now be assigned arbitrary namespace IDs, and the number of namespaces per subsystem is no longer limited.</p>
<p>The NVMe-oF target now supports the Write Zeroes command.</p>
<h2>Environment Abstraction Layer</h2>
<p>A new default value, SPDK_MEMPOOL_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE, was added to provide additional clarity when constructing spdk_mempools. Previously, -1 could be passed and the library would choose a reasonable default, but this new value makes it explicit that the default is being used.</p>
<h2>Blobstore</h2>
<p>The blobstore super block now contains a bstype field to identify the type of the blobstore. Existing code should be updated to fill out bstype when calling <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#ad59f1d147b612a7d4ce1eb8439a69cee" title="Initialize a blobstore on the given device.">spdk_bs_init()</a> and <a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a400da20b69e4f914730fbd15d51eb748" title="Load a blobstore from the given device.">spdk_bs_load()</a>.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="blob_8h.html#a0ba54d7b0d88a136bbfc9f93bc10b87d" title="Destroy the blobstore.">spdk_bs_destroy()</a> was added to allow destroying blobstore on device with an initialized blobstore.</p>
<p>spdk_bs_io_readv_blob() and spdk_bs_io_writev_blob() were added to enable scattered payloads.</p>
<p>A CLI tool for blobstore has been added, allowing basic operations through either command line or shell interface. See the <a href="https://github.com/spdk/spdk/tree/master/examples/blob/cli">blobcli</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<h2>Event Framework</h2>
<p>The ability to set a thread name, previously only used by the reactor code, is now part of the spdk_thread_allocate() API. Users may specify a thread name which will show up in tools like <code>gdb</code>.</p>
<h2>Log</h2>
<p>The spdk_trace_dump() function now takes a new parameter to allow the caller to specify an output file handle (stdout or stderr, for example).</p>
<h2>Logical Volumes</h2>
<p>Logical volumes library built on top of SPDK blobstore has been added. It is possible to create logical volumes on top of other devices using RPC.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/logical_volumes.html">logical volumes</a> documentation for more information.</p>
<h2>Persistent Memory</h2>
<p>A new persistent memory bdev type has been added. The persistent memory block device is built on top of <a href="http://pmem.io/nvml/libpmemblk/">libpmemblk</a>. It is possible to create pmem devices on top of pmem pool files using RPC.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#bdev_config_pmem">Pmem Block Device</a> documentation for more information.</p>
<h2>Virtio SCSI driver</h2>
<p>A userspace driver for Virtio SCSI devices has been added. The driver is capable of creating block devices on top of LUNs exposed by another SPDK vhost-scsi application.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/virtio.html">Virtio SCSI</a> documentation and <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#bdev_config_virtio_scsi">Getting Started</a> guide for more information.</p>
<h2>Vhost target</h2>
<p>The vhost target application now supports live migration between QEMU instances.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v17-07"></a>
v17.07: Build system improvements, userspace vhost-blk target, and GPT bdev</h1>
<h2>Build System</h2>
<p>A <code>configure</code> script has been added to simplify the build configuration process. The existing CONFIG file and <code>make CONFIG_...</code> options are also still supported. Run <code>./configure --help</code> for information about available configuration options.</p>
<p>A DPDK submodule has been added to make building SPDK easier. If no <code>--with-dpdk</code> option is specified to configure, the SPDK build system will automatically build a known-good configuration of DPDK with the minimal options enabled. See the Building section of README.md for more information.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> setup has been added to make it easier to develop and use SPDK on systems without suitable NVMe hardware. See the Vagrant section of README.md for more information.</p>
<h2>Userspace vhost-blk target</h2>
<p>The vhost library and example app have been updated to support the vhost-blk protocol in addition to the existing vhost-scsi protocol. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/vhost.html">vhost documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Block device abstraction layer (bdev)</h2>
<p>A GPT virtual block device has been added, which automatically exposes GPT partitions with a special SPDK-specific partition type as bdevs. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/bdev.md#bdev_config_gpt">GPT bdev documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>NVMe driver</h2>
<p>The NVMe driver has been updated to support recent Intel SSDs, including the Intel® Optane™ SSD DC P4800X series.</p>
<p>A workaround has been added for devices that failed to recognize register writes during controller reset.</p>
<p>The NVMe driver now allocates request tracking objects on a per-queue basis. The number of requests allowed on an I/O queue may be set during <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a225bbc386ec518ae21bd5536f21db45d" title="Enumerate the bus indicated by the transport ID and attach the userspace NVMe driver to each device f...">spdk_nvme_probe()</a></code> by modifying <code>io_queue_requests</code> in the opts structure.</p>
<p>The SPDK NVMe <code>fio_plugin</code> has been updated to support multiple threads (<code>numjobs</code>).</p>
<p><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a13f745d239dab9b8f934fae2ad4984a2" title="Allocate an I/O queue pair (submission and completion queue).">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_alloc_io_qpair()</a> has been modified to allow the user to override controller-level options for each individual I/O queue pair. Existing callers with qprio == 0 can be updated to: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">... = spdk_nvme_ctrlr_alloc_io_qpair(ctrlr, NULL, 0);</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Callers that need to specify a non-default qprio should be updated to: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">struct spdk_nvme_io_qpair_opts opts;</div>

<div class="line">... = spdk_nvme_ctrlr_alloc_io_qpair(ctrlr, &amp;opts, sizeof(opts));</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2>Environment Abstraction Layer</h2>
<p>The environment abstraction layer has been updated to include several new functions in order to wrap additional DPDK functionality. See <code><a class="el" href="env_8h.html" title="Encapsulated third-party dependencies.">include/spdk/env.h</a></code> for the current set of functions.</p>
<h2>SPDK Performance Analysis with Intel® VTune™ Amplifier</h2>
<p>Support for SPDK performance analysis has been added to Intel® VTune™ Amplifier 2018.</p>
<p>This analysis provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>I/O performance monitoring (calculating standard I/O metrics like IOPS, throughput, etc.)</li>
<li>Tuning insights on the interplay of I/O and compute devices by estimating how many cores would be reasonable to provide for SPDK to keep up with a current storage workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the VTune Amplifier documentation for more information.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v17-03"></a>
v17.03: Blobstore and userspace vhost-scsi target</h1>
<h2>Blobstore and BlobFS</h2>
<p>The blobstore is a persistent, power-fail safe block allocator designed to be used as the local storage system backing a higher-level storage service. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/blob.html">blobstore documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>BlobFS adds basic filesystem functionality like filenames on top of the blobstore. This release also includes a RocksDB Env implementation using BlobFS in place of the kernel filesystem. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/blobfs.html">BlobFS documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Userspace vhost-scsi target</h2>
<p>A userspace implementation of the QEMU vhost-scsi protocol has been added. The vhost target is capable of exporting SPDK bdevs to QEMU-based VMs as virtio devices. See the <a href="http://www.spdk.io/doc/vhost.html">vhost documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Event framework</h2>
<p>The overhead of the main reactor event loop was reduced by optimizing the number of calls to <a class="el" href="env_8h.html#a7d868d272aa0c000f6135966dfadc596" title="Get a monotonic timestamp counter.">spdk_get_ticks()</a> per iteration.</p>
<h2>NVMe library</h2>
<p>The NVMe library will now automatically split readv/writev requests with scatter-gather lists that do not map to valid PRP lists when the NVMe controller does not natively support SGLs.</p>
<p>The <code>identify</code> and <code>perf</code> NVMe examples were modified to add a consistent format for specifying remote NVMe over Fabrics devices via the <code>-r</code> option. This is implemented using the new <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ac37484cc5d14777e4ae1fde031d0edf2" title="Parse the string representation of a transport ID.">spdk_nvme_transport_id_parse()</a></code> function.</p>
<h2>iSCSI Target</h2>
<p>The [Nvme] section of the configuration file was modified to remove the <code>BDF</code> directive and replace it with a <code>TransportID</code> directive. Both local (PCIe) and remote (NVMe-oF) devices can now be specified as the backing block device. A script to generate an entire [Nvme] section based on the local NVMe devices attached was added at <code>scripts/gen_nvme.sh</code>.</p>
<h2>NVMe-oF Target</h2>
<p>The [Nvme] section of the configuration file was modified to remove the <code>BDF</code> directive and replace it with a <code>TransportID</code> directive. Both local (PCIe) and remote (NVMe-oF) devices can now be specified as the backing block device. A script to generate an entire [Nvme] section based on the local NVMe devices attached was added at <code>scripts/gen_nvme.sh</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v16-12"></a>
v16.12: NVMe over Fabrics host, hotplug, and multi-process</h1>
<h2>NVMe library</h2>
<p>The NVMe library has been changed to create its own request memory pool rather than requiring the user to initialize the global <code>request_mempool</code> variable. Apps can be updated by simply removing the initialization of <code>request_mempool</code>. Since the NVMe library user no longer needs to know the size of the internal NVMe request structure to create the pool, the <code>spdk_nvme_request_size()</code> function was also removed.</p>
<p>The <code>spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_deallocate()</code> function was renamed and extended to become <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ac0c646dd18675c54ffcf834ce699658d" title="Submit a data set management request to the specified NVMe namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_dataset_management()</a></code>, which allows access to all of the NVMe Dataset Management command's parameters. Existing callers can be updated to use <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#ac0c646dd18675c54ffcf834ce699658d" title="Submit a data set management request to the specified NVMe namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_dataset_management()</a></code> with <code>SPDK_NVME_DSM_ATTR_DEALLOCATE</code> as the <code>type</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The NVMe library SGL callback prototype has been changed to return virtual addresses rather than physical addresses. Callers of <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#acb47ce7de6b6e963ec9fb8de261466ae" title="Submit a read I/O to the specified NVMe namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_readv()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#adfcbb5d31f0b572847cc8ae8b07dfcfb" title="Submit a write I/O to the specified NVMe namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_writev()</a></code> must update their <code>next_sge_fn</code> callbacks to match.</p>
<p>The NVMe library now supports NVMe over Fabrics devices in addition to the existing support for local PCIe-attached NVMe devices. For an example of how to enable NVMe over Fabrics support in an application, see <code>examples/nvme/identify</code> and <code>examples/nvme/perf</code>.</p>
<p>Hot insert/remove support for NVMe devices has been added. To enable NVMe hotplug support, an application should call the <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a225bbc386ec518ae21bd5536f21db45d" title="Enumerate the bus indicated by the transport ID and attach the userspace NVMe driver to each device f...">spdk_nvme_probe()</a></code> function on a regular basis to probe for new devices (reported via the existing <code>probe_cb</code> callback) and removed devices (reported via a new <code>remove_cb</code> callback). Hotplug is currently only supported on Linux with the <code>uio_pci_generic</code> driver, and newly-added NVMe devices must be bound to <code>uio_pci_generic</code> by an external script or tool.</p>
<p>Multiple processes may now coordinate and use a single NVMe device simultaneously using <a href="http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/prog_guide/multi_proc_support.html">DPDK Multi-process Support</a>.</p>
<h2>NVMe over Fabrics target (<code>nvmf_tgt</code>)</h2>
<p>The <code>nvmf_tgt</code> configuration file format has been updated significantly to enable new features. See the example configuration file <code>etc/spdk/nvmf.conf.in</code> for more details on the new and changed options.</p>
<p>The NVMe over Fabrics target now supports virtual mode subsystems, which allow the user to export devices from the SPDK block device abstraction layer as NVMe over Fabrics subsystems. Direct mode (raw NVMe device access) is also still supported, and a single <code>nvmf_tgt</code> may export both types of subsystems simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Block device abstraction layer (bdev)</h2>
<p>The bdev layer now supports scatter/gather read and write I/O APIs, and the NVMe blockdev driver has been updated to support scatter/gather. Apps can use the new scatter/gather support via the <code><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#ga9ac9efa882e87909acfd4bccaddb1778" title="Submit a read request to the bdev on the given channel.">spdk_bdev_readv()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="group__bdev__io__submit__functions.html#ga9a508a1c301a1321faf0680a8f31f59a" title="Submit a write request to the bdev on the given channel.">spdk_bdev_writev()</a></code> functions.</p>
<p>The bdev status returned from each I/O has been extended to pass through NVMe or SCSI status codes directly in cases where the underlying device can provide a more specific status code.</p>
<p>A Ceph RBD (RADOS Block Device) blockdev driver has been added. This allows the <code>iscsi_tgt</code> and <code>nvmf_tgt</code> apps to export Ceph RBD volumes as iSCSI LUNs or NVMe namespaces.</p>
<h2>General changes</h2>
<p><code>libpciaccess</code> has been removed as a dependency and DPDK PCI enumeration is used instead. Prior to DPDK 16.07 enumeration by class code was not supported, so for earlier DPDK versions, only Intel SSD DC P3x00 devices will be discovered by the NVMe library.</p>
<p>The <code>env</code> environment abstraction library has been introduced, and a default DPDK-based implementation is provided as part of SPDK. The goal of the <code>env</code> layer is to enable use of alternate user-mode memory allocation and PCI access libraries. See <code>doc/porting.md</code> for more details.</p>
<p>The build process has been modified to produce all of the library files in the <code>build/lib</code> directory. This is intended to simplify the use of SPDK from external projects, which can now link to SPDK libraries by adding the <code>build/lib</code> directory to the library path via <code>-L</code> and linking the SPDK libraries by name (for example, <code>-lspdk_nvme -lspdk_log -lspdk_util</code>).</p>
<p><code>nvmf_tgt</code> and <code>iscsi_tgt</code> now have a JSON-RPC interface, which allows the user to query and modify the configuration at runtime. The RPC service is disabled by default, since it currently does not provide any authentication or security mechanisms; it should only be enabled on systems with controlled user access behind a firewall. An example RPC client implemented in Python is provided in <code>scripts/rpc.py</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v16-08"></a>
v16.08: iSCSI target, NVMe over Fabrics maturity</h1>
<p>This release adds a userspace iSCSI target. The iSCSI target is capable of exporting NVMe devices over a network using the iSCSI protocol. The application is located in app/iscsi_tgt and a documented configuration file can be found at etc/spdk/spdk.conf.in.</p>
<p>This release also significantly improves the existing NVMe over Fabrics target.</p>
<ul>
<li>The configuration file format was changed, which will require updates to any existing nvmf.conf files (see <code>etc/spdk/nvmf.conf.in</code>):<ul>
<li><code>SubsystemGroup</code> was renamed to <code>Subsystem</code>.</li>
<li><code>AuthFile</code> was removed (it was unimplemented).</li>
<li><code>nvmf_tgt</code> was updated to correctly recognize NQN (NVMe Qualified Names) when naming subsystems. The default node name was changed to reflect this; it is now "nqn.2016-06.io.spdk".</li>
<li><code>Port</code> and <code>Host</code> sections were merged into the <code>Subsystem</code> section</li>
<li>Global options to control max queue depth, number of queues, max I/O size, and max in-capsule data size were added.</li>
<li>The Nvme section was removed. Now a list of devices is specified by bus/device/function directly in the Subsystem section.</li>
<li>Subsystems now have a Mode, which can be Direct or Virtual. This is an attempt to future-proof the interface, so the only mode supported by this release is "Direct".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many bug fixes and cleanups were applied to the <code>nvmf_tgt</code> app and library.</li>
<li>The target now supports discovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also adds one new feature and provides some better examples and tools for the NVMe driver.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Weighted Round Robin arbitration method is now supported. This allows the user to specify different priorities on a per-I/O-queue basis. To enable WRR, set the <code>arb_mechanism</code> field during <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a225bbc386ec518ae21bd5536f21db45d" title="Enumerate the bus indicated by the transport ID and attach the userspace NVMe driver to each device f...">spdk_nvme_probe()</a></code>.</li>
<li>A simplified "Hello World" example was added to show the proper way to use the NVMe library API; see <code>examples/nvme/hello_world/hello_world.c</code>.</li>
<li>A test for measuring software overhead was added. See <code>test/lib/nvme/overhead</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="changelog-v16-06"></a>
v16.06: NVMf userspace target</h1>
<p>This release adds a userspace NVMf (NVMe over Fabrics) target, conforming to the newly-released NVMf 1.0/NVMe 1.2.1 specification. The NVMf target exports NVMe devices from a host machine over the network via RDMA. Currently, the target is limited to directly exporting physical NVMe devices, and the discovery subsystem is not supported.</p>
<p>This release includes a general API cleanup, including renaming all declarations in public headers to include a <code>spdk</code> prefix to prevent namespace clashes with user code.</p>
<ul>
<li>NVMe<ul>
<li>The <code>nvme_attach()</code> API was reworked into a new probe/attach model, which moves device detection into the NVMe library. The new API also allows parallel initialization of NVMe controllers, providing a major reduction in startup time when using multiple controllers.</li>
<li>I/O queue allocation was changed to be explicit in the API. Each function that generates I/O requests now takes a queue pair (<code>spdk_nvme_qpair *</code>) argument, and I/O queues may be allocated using <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#a13f745d239dab9b8f934fae2ad4984a2" title="Allocate an I/O queue pair (submission and completion queue).">spdk_nvme_ctrlr_alloc_io_qpair()</a></code>. This allows more flexible assignment of queue pairs than the previous model, which only allowed a single queue per thread and limited the total number of I/O queues to the lowest number supported on any attached controller.</li>
<li>Added support for the Write Zeroes command.</li>
<li><code>examples/nvme/perf</code> can now report I/O command latency from the the controller's viewpoint using the Intel vendor-specific read/write latency log page.</li>
<li>Added namespace reservation command support, which can be used to coordinate sharing of a namespace between multiple hosts.</li>
<li>Added hardware SGL support, which enables use of scattered buffers that don't conform to the PRP list alignment and length requirements on supported NVMe controllers.</li>
<li>Added end-to-end data protection support, including the ability to write and read metadata in extended LBA (metadata appended to each block of data in the buffer) and separate metadata buffer modes. See <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#adc2aa2be0d657be0c63d5abc02b274ec" title="Submit a write I/O to the specified NVMe namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_write_with_md()</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="nvme_8h.html#aa2913b93326e636eca6dfe7b42e349fe" title="Submits a read I/O to the specified NVMe namespace.">spdk_nvme_ns_cmd_read_with_md()</a></code> for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IOAT<ul>
<li>The DMA block fill feature is now exposed via the <code>ioat_submit_fill()</code> function. This is functionally similar to <code>memset()</code>, except the memory is filled with an 8-byte repeating pattern instead of a single byte like memset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PCI<ul>
<li>Added support for using DPDK for PCI device mapping in addition to the existing libpciaccess option. Using the DPDK PCI support also allows use of the Linux VFIO driver model, which means that SPDK userspace drivers will work with the IOMMU enabled. Additionally, SPDK applications may be run as an unprivileged user with access restricted to a specific set of PCIe devices.</li>
<li>The PCI library API was made more generic to abstract away differences between the underlying PCI access implementations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>v1.2.0: IOAT user-space driver</h1>
<p>This release adds a user-space driver with support for the Intel I/O Acceleration Technology (I/OAT, also known as "Crystal Beach") DMA offload engine.</p>

<li>Example programs <code>ioat/perf</code> and <code>ioat/verify</code></li>
<li>Kernel-mode DMA engine test driver <code>kperf</code> for performance comparison</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NVMe<ul>
<li>Per-I/O flags for Force Unit Access (FUA) and Limited Retry</li>
<li>Public API for retrieving log pages</li>
<li>Reservation register/acquire/release/report command support</li>
