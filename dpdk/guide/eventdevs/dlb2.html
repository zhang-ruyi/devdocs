<h2><span class="section-number">2.2. </span>Configuration</h2>
<p>The DLB2 PF PMD is a user-space PMD that uses VFIO to gain direct
device access. To use this operation mode, the PCIe PF device must be bound
to a DPDK-compatible VFIO driver, such as vfio-pci.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="eventdev-api-notes">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.3. </span>Eventdev API Notes</h2>
<p>The DLB2 provides the functions of a DPDK event device; specifically, it
supports atomic, ordered, and parallel scheduling events from queues to ports.
However, the DLB2 hardware is not a perfect match to the eventdev API. Some DLB2
features are abstracted by the PMD such as directed ports.</p>
<p>In general the dlb PMD is designed for ease-of-use and does not require a
detailed understanding of the hardware, but these details are important when
writing high-performance code. This section describes the places where the
eventdev API and DLB2 misalign.</p>
<div class="section" id="scheduling-domain-configuration">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.1. </span>Scheduling Domain Configuration</h3>
<p>There are 32 scheduling domainis the DLB2.
When one is configured, it allocates load-balanced and
directed queues, ports, credits, and other hardware resources. Some
resource allocations are user-controlled – the number of queues, for example
– and others, like credit pools (one directed and one load-balanced pool per
scheduling domain), are not.</p>
<p>The DLB2 is a closed system eventdev, and as such the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_events_limit</span></code> device
setup argument and the per-port <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">new_event_threshold</span></code> argument apply as
defined in the eventdev header file. The limit is applied to all enqueues,
regardless of whether it will consume a directed or load-balanced credit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="load-balanced-queues">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.2. </span>Load-Balanced Queues</h3>
<p>A load-balanced queue can support atomic and ordered scheduling, or atomic and
unordered scheduling, but not atomic and unordered and ordered scheduling. A
queue’s scheduling types are controlled by the event queue configuration.</p>
<p>If the user sets the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_EVENT_QUEUE_CFG_ALL_TYPES</span></code> flag, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_atomic_order_sequences</span></code> determines the supported scheduling types.
With non-zero <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_atomic_order_sequences</span></code>, the queue is configured for atomic
and ordered scheduling. In this case, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_SCHED_TYPE_PARALLEL</span></code> scheduling is
supported by scheduling those events as ordered events.  Note that when the
event is dequeued, its sched_type will be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_SCHED_TYPE_ORDERED</span></code>. Else if
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_atomic_order_sequences</span></code> is zero, the queue is configured for atomic and
unordered scheduling. In this case, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_SCHED_TYPE_ORDERED</span></code> is unsupported.</p>
<p>If the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_EVENT_QUEUE_CFG_ALL_TYPES</span></code> flag is not set, schedule_type
dictates the queue’s scheduling type.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_atomic_order_sequences</span></code> queue configuration field sets the ordered
queue’s reorder buffer size.  DLB2 has 4 groups of ordered queues, where each
group is configured to contain either 1 queue with 1024 reorder entries, 2
queues with 512 reorder entries, and so on down to 32 queues with 32 entries.</p>
<p>When a load-balanced queue is created, the PMD will configure a new sequence
number group on-demand if num_sequence_numbers does not match a pre-existing
group with available reorder buffer entries. If all sequence number groups are
in use, no new group will be created and queue configuration will fail. (Note
that when the PMD is used with a virtual DLB2 device, it cannot change the
sequence number configuration.)</p>
<p>The queue’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_atomic_flows</span></code> parameter is ignored by the DLB2 PMD, because
the DLB2 does not limit the number of flows a queue can track. In the DLB2, all
load-balanced queues can use the full 16-bit flow ID range.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="load-balanced-and-directed-ports">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.4. </span>Load-balanced and Directed Ports</h3>
<p>DLB2 ports come in two flavors: load-balanced and directed. The eventdev API
does not have the same concept, but it has a similar one: ports and queues that
are singly-linked (i.e. linked to a single queue or port, respectively).</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rte_event_dev_info_get()</span></code> function reports the number of available
event ports and queues (among other things). For the DLB2 PMD, max_event_ports
and max_event_queues report the number of available load-balanced ports and
queues, and max_single_link_event_port_queue_pairs reports the number of
available directed ports and queues.</p>
<p>When a scheduling domain is created in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rte_event_dev_configure()</span></code>, the user
specifies <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_event_ports</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_single_link_event_port_queues</span></code>, which
control the total number of ports (load-balanced and directed) and the number
of directed ports. Hence, the number of requested load-balanced ports is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_event_ports</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">nb_single_link_event_ports</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_event_queues</span></code> field
specifies the total number of queues (load-balanced and directed). The number
of directed queues comes from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nb_single_link_event_port_queues</span></code>, since
directed ports and queues come in pairs.</p>
<p>When a port is setup, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_EVENT_PORT_CFG_SINGLE_LINK</span></code> flag determines
whether it should be configured as a directed (the flag is set) or a
load-balanced (the flag is unset) port. Similarly, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_EVENT_QUEUE_CFG_SINGLE_LINK</span></code> queue configuration flag controls
whether it is a directed or load-balanced queue.</p>
<p>Load-balanced ports can only be linked to load-balanced queues, and directed
ports can only be linked to directed queues. Furthermore, directed ports can
only be linked to a single directed queue (and vice versa), and that link
cannot change after the eventdev is started.</p>
<p>The eventdev API does not have a directed scheduling type. To support directed
traffic, the dlb PMD detects when an event is being sent to a directed queue
and overrides its scheduling type. Note that the originally selected scheduling
type (atomic, ordered, or parallel) is not preserved, and an event’s sched_type
will be set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RTE_SCHED_TYPE_ATOMIC</span></code> when it is dequeued from a directed
port.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flow-id">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.5. </span>Flow ID</h3>
<p>The flow ID field is preserved in the event when it is scheduled in the
DLB2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware-credits">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.6. </span>Hardware Credits</h3>
<p>DLB2 uses a hardware credit scheme to prevent software from overflowing hardware
event storage, with each unit of storage represented by a credit. A port spends
a credit to enqueue an event, and hardware refills the ports with credits as the
events are scheduled to ports. Refills come from credit pools, and each port is
a member of a load-balanced credit pool and a directed credit pool. The
load-balanced credits are used to enqueue to load-balanced queues, and directed
credits are used for directed queues.</p>
<p>A DLB2 eventdev contains one load-balanced and one directed credit pool. These
pools’ sizes are controlled by the nb_events_limit field in struct
rte_event_dev_config. The load-balanced pool is sized to contain
nb_events_limit credits, and the directed pool is sized to contain
nb_events_limit/4 credits. The directed pool size can be overridden with the
num_dir_credits vdev argument, like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">--vdev=dlb1_event,num_dir_credits=&lt;value&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This can be used if the default allocation is too low or too high for the
specific application needs. The PMD also supports a vdev arg that limits the
max_num_events reported by rte_event_dev_info_get():</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">--vdev=dlb1_event,max_num_events=&lt;value&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>By default, max_num_events is reported as the total available load-balanced
credits. If multiple DLB2-based applications are being used, it may be desirable
to control how many load-balanced credits each application uses, particularly
when application(s) are written to configure nb_events_limit equal to the
reported max_num_events.</p>
<p>Each port is a member of both credit pools. A port’s credit allocation is
defined by its low watermark, high watermark, and refill quanta. These three
parameters are calculated by the dlb PMD like so:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The load-balanced high watermark is set to the port’s enqueue_depth.
The directed high watermark is set to the minimum of the enqueue_depth and
the directed pool size divided by the total number of ports.</p></li>
<li><p>The refill quanta is set to half the high watermark.</p></li>
<li><p>The low watermark is set to the minimum of 16 and the refill quanta.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the eventdev is started, each port is pre-allocated a high watermark’s
worth of credits. For example, if an eventdev contains four ports with enqueue
depths of 32 and a load-balanced credit pool size of 4096, each port will start
with 32 load-balanced credits, and there will be 3968 credits available to
replenish the ports. Thus, a single port is not capable of enqueueing up to the
nb_events_limit (without any events being dequeued), since the other ports are
retaining their initial credit allocation; in short, all ports must enqueue in
order to reach the limit.</p>
<p>If a port attempts to enqueue and has no credits available, the enqueue
operation will fail and the application must retry the enqueue. Credits are
replenished asynchronously by the DLB2 hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-credits">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.7. </span>Software Credits</h3>
<p>The DLB2 is a “closed system” event dev, and the DLB2 PMD layers a software
credit scheme on top of the hardware credit scheme in order to comply with
the per-port backpressure described in the eventdev API.</p>
<p>The DLB2’s hardware scheme is local to a queue/pipeline stage: a port spends a
credit when it enqueues to a queue, and credits are later replenished after the
events are dequeued and released.</p>
<p>In the software credit scheme, a credit is consumed when a new (.op =
RTE_EVENT_OP_NEW) event is injected into the system, and the credit is
replenished when the event is released from the system (either explicitly with
RTE_EVENT_OP_RELEASE or implicitly in dequeue_burst()).</p>
<p>In this model, an event is “in the system” from its first enqueue into eventdev
until it is last dequeued. If the event goes through multiple event queues, it
is still considered “in the system” while a worker thread is processing it.</p>
<p>A port will fail to enqueue if the number of events in the system exceeds its
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">new_event_threshold</span></code> (specified at port setup time). A port will also fail
to enqueue if it lacks enough hardware credits to enqueue; load-balanced
credits are used to enqueue to a load-balanced queue, and directed credits are
used to enqueue to a directed queue.</p>
<p>The out-of-credit situations are typically transient, and an eventdev
application using the DLB2 ought to retry its enqueues if they fail.
If enqueue fails, DLB2 PMD sets rte_errno as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>-ENOSPC: Credit exhaustion (either hardware or software)</p></li>
<li><p>-EINVAL: Invalid argument, such as port ID, queue ID, or sched_type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the pipeline the application has constructed, it’s possible to
enter a credit deadlock scenario wherein the worker thread lacks the credit
to enqueue an event, and it must dequeue an event before it can recover the
credit. If the worker thread retries its enqueue indefinitely, it will not
make forward progress. Such deadlock is possible if the application has event
“loops”, in which an event in dequeued from queue A and later enqueued back to
queue A.</p>
<p>Due to this, workers should stop retrying after a time, release the events it
is attempting to enqueue, and dequeue more events. It is important that the
worker release the events and don’t simply set them aside to retry the enqueue
again later, because the port has limited history list size (by default, twice
the port’s dequeue_depth).</p>

<div class="section" id="priority">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.8. </span>Priority</h3>
<p>The DLB2 supports event priority and per-port queue service priority, as
described in the eventdev header file. The DLB2 does not support ‘global’ event
queue priority established at queue creation time.</p>
<p>DLB2 supports 8 event and queue service priority levels. For both priority
types, the PMD uses the upper three bits of the priority field to determine the
DLB2 priority, discarding the 5 least significant bits. The 5 least significant
event priority bits are not preserved when an event is enqueued.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reconfiguration">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.9. </span>Reconfiguration</h3>
<p>The Eventdev API allows one to reconfigure a device, its ports, and its queues
by first stopping the device, calling the configuration function(s), then
restarting the device. The DLB2 does not support configuring an individual queue
or port without first reconfiguring the entire device, however, so there are
certain reconfiguration sequences that are valid in the eventdev API but not
supported by the PMD.</p>
<p>Specifically, the PMD supports the following configuration sequence:
1. Configure and start the device
2. Stop the device
3. (Optional) Reconfigure the device
4. (Optional) If step 3 is run:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Setup queue(s). The reconfigured queue(s) lose their previous port links.</p></li>
<li><p>The reconfigured port(s) lose their previous queue links.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>(Optional, only if steps 4a and 4b are run) Link port(s) to queue(s)</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the device. If the device is reconfigured in step 3 but one or more
of its ports or queues are not, the PMD will apply their previous
configuration (including port-&gt;queue links) at this time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The PMD does not support the following configuration sequences:
1. Configure and start the device
2. Stop the device
3. Setup queue or setup port
4. Start the device</p>
<p>This sequence is not supported because the event device must be reconfigured
before its ports or queues can be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deferred-scheduling">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.10. </span>Deferred Scheduling</h3>
<p>The DLB2 PMD’s default behavior for managing a CQ is to “pop” the CQ once per
dequeued event before returning from rte_event_dequeue_burst(). This frees the
corresponding entries in the CQ, which enables the DLB2 to schedule more events
to it.</p>
<p>To support applications seeking finer-grained scheduling control – for example
deferring scheduling to get the best possible priority scheduling and
load-balancing – the PMD supports a deferred scheduling mode. In this mode,
the CQ entry is not popped until the <em>subsequent</em> rte_event_dequeue_burst()
call. This mode only applies to load-balanced event ports with dequeue depth of
1.</p>
<p>To enable deferred scheduling, use the defer_sched vdev argument like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">--vdev=dlb1_event,defer_sched=on</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="atomic-inflights-allocation">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.11. </span>Atomic Inflights Allocation</h3>
<p>In the last stage prior to scheduling an atomic event to a CQ, DLB2 holds the
inflight event in a temporary buffer that is divided among load-balanced
queues. If a queue’s atomic buffer storage fills up, this can result in
head-of-line-blocking. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An LDB queue allocated N atomic buffer entries</p></li>
<li><p>All N entries are filled with events from flow X, which is pinned to CQ 0.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Until CQ 0 releases 1+ events, no other atomic flows for that LDB queue can be
scheduled. The likelihood of this case depends on the eventdev configuration,
traffic behavior, event processing latency, potential for a worker to be
interrupted or otherwise delayed, etc.</p>
<p>By default, the PMD allocates 16 buffer entries for each load-balanced queue,
which provides an even division across all 128 queues but potentially wastes
buffer space (e.g. if not all queues are used, or aren’t used for atomic
scheduling).</p>
<p>The PMD provides a dev arg to override the default per-queue allocation. To
increase a vdev’s per-queue atomic-inflight allocation to (for example) 64:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">--vdev=dlb1_event,atm_inflights=64</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qid-depth-threshold">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.12. </span>QID Depth Threshold</h3>
<p>DLB2 supports setting and tracking queue depth thresholds. Hardware uses
the thresholds to track how full a queue is compared to its threshold.
Four buckets are used</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Less than or equal to 50% of queue depth threshold</p></li>
<li><p>Greater than 50%, but less than or equal to 75% of depth threshold</p></li>
<li><p>Greater than 75%, but less than or equal to 100% of depth threshold</p></li>
<li><p>Greater than 100% of depth thresholds</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Per queue threshold metrics are tracked in the DLB2 xstats, and are also
returned in the impl_opaque field of each received event.</p>
<p>The per qid threshold can be specified as part of the device args, and
can be applied to all queue, a range of queues, or a single queue, as
shown below.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="section" id="class-of-service">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.3.13. </span>Class of service</h3>
<p>DLB2 supports provisioning the DLB2 bandwidth into 4 classes of service.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Class 4 corresponds to 40% of the DLB2 hardware bandwidth</p></li>
<li><p>Class 3 corresponds to 30% of the DLB2 hardware bandwidth</p></li>
<li><p>Class 2 corresponds to 20% of the DLB2 hardware bandwidth</p></li>
<li><p>Class 1 corresponds to 10% of the DLB2 hardware bandwidth</p></li>
<li><p>Class 0 corresponds to don’t care</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The classes are applied globally to the set of ports contained in this
scheduling domain, which is more appropriate for the bifurcated
PMD than for the PF PMD, since the PF PMD supports just 1 scheduling
domain.</p>
<p>Class of service can be specified in the devargs, as follows</p>
